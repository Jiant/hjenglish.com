The problem of how health-care resources should e allocated or apportioned, so that they are distributed in both the most just and most efficient way is not a new one.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t分析：&ldquo;how health-care resources should e allocated or apportioned, so that they are distributed in both the most just and most efficient way&rdquo;为句子中介词of的宾语。而&ldquo;so that they are distributed in both the most just and most efficient way&rdquo;为介词宾语中so that引导的目的状语从句。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2. Looking back, it now seems quite incredible that in the national health systems that emerged in many countries in the years immediately after the 1939-45 World War, it was assumed without question that all the basic health needs of any community could be satisfied, at least in principle.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t分析：&ldquo;that in the national health systems that emerged in many countries in the years immediately after the 1939-45 World War, it was assumed without question that all the basic health needs of any community could be satisfied, at least in principle&rdquo;为that引导的主语从句，&ldquo;it now seems&rdquo;中的it为形式主语；&ldquo;that emerged in many countries in the years immediately after the 1939-45 World War&rdquo;为that引导的定语从句，其先行词为the national health systems；&ldquo;that all the basic health needs of any community could be satisfied, at least in principle&rdquo;为that引导的主语从句，it为形式主语。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3. However, at exactly the same time as this new realization of the finite character of health-care resources was sinking in, an awareness of a contrary kind was developing in Western societies: that people have a basic right to health-care as a necessary condition of a proper human life.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t分析：&ldquo;as this new realization of the finite character of health-care resources was sinking in&rdquo;为as引导的定语从句，其先行词为the same time；&ldquo;that people have a basic right to health-care as a necessary condition of a proper human life&rdquo;为that引导的同位语从句，其先行词为an awareness of a contrary kind.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>4. Although the language of &lsquo;right&rsquo; sometimes leads to confusion, by the late 1970s it was recognized in most societies that people have a right to health-care (though there has been considerable resistance in the United States to the idea that there is a formal right to health-care).</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t分析：&ldquo;Although the language of &lsquo;right&rsquo; sometimes leads to confusion&rdquo;为although引导的让步状语从句；&ldquo;that people have a right to health-care&rdquo;为that引导的主语从句，it为形式主语；&ldquo;though there has been considerable resistance in the United States to the idea that there is a formal right to health-care&rdquo;为though引导的让步状语从句；&ldquo;that there is a formal right to health-care&rdquo;为that引导的同位语从句，其先行词为the idea。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>5. It is also accepted that this right generates an obligation or duty for the state to ensure that adequate health-care resources are provided out of the public purse.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t分析：&ldquo;that this right generates an obligation or duty for the state to ensure that adequate health-care resources are provided out of the public purse.&rdquo;为that引导的主语从句，It为其形式主语；&ldquo;that adequate health-care resources are provided out of the public purse&rdquo;为that引导的宾语从句，作ensure的宾语。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>6. One would assume that the caliber of these institutions would have been carefully examined, but it appears that the criterion for inclusion on this select list might merely be that the zoo is a member of a zoo federation or association.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t分析：&ldquo;that the caliber of these institutions would have been carefully examined&rdquo;为that引导的宾语从句，作assume的宾语；&ldquo;that the criterion for inclusion on this select list might merely be that the zoo is a member of a zoo federation or association&rdquo;为that引导的主语从句，it为其形式主语；&ldquo;that the zoo is a member of a zoo federation or association&rdquo;为that引导的表语从句，作be的表语。</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p231467/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p231467\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p161331/\">新概念英语第一册Lesson 1  Excuse me</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p161329/\">新概念英语第一册Lesson 5  Nice to meet you</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p109055/\">【新概念英语从头学】第一册第1课</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p727775/\">我们为什么要学习一门外语？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p161535/\">新概念英语第二册Lesson 1 A private conversation</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p161439/\">新概念英语第三册Lesson 1 A Puma at large</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p161330/\">新概念英语第一册Lesson 3 Sorry sir.</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p140075/\">【经典英语从头学】新概念英语二第1课：私人谈话</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p730516/\">英诗赏析：罗赛蒂《歌》 徐志摩译罗大佑曲</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p730677/\">夏天不再单调：8大技巧助你变身编发达人</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
