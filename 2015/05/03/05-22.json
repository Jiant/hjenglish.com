  "description": "<p>\n\t<strong>Rehearse</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAfter organizing ones thought, students should practice on how to deliver their organized thinking and ideas out loud to themselves and, if appropriate, to a few others. Do it out loud because the words always come out right in your head, but if you have to speak them you'll catch some problems before hand. Most of the time students know what they want to say but when they say it out will be quite different from what they had thought. Do it again repeatedly. Keep doing it until you are comfortable and improved. Rehearsing is also a good way to build a student&rsquo;s confidence in speaking. Practice makes perfect , it can really give student an ideal score in the exam.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Clear</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tTo be able to be understood in an integrated task,&nbsp; students should speak with a firm, strong and confident voice. Examiners tend to pay&nbsp; more attention if the student speaks with confidence. On the other hand, examiners get bored and sleepy when the student speaks with a voice as soft as a whisper or as slow as a donkey walk. Each syllable should be pronounced very clearly and accurately.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it would be best if the student can deliver their answer with the proper diction and accent. There are times that examiners get distracted with the accent of the student. Because of this, the examiners tend to get the wrong information as the student meant it this way, but his accent give the words different meaning already. Some examiners would then find the whole thing funny and weird. A student must have confidence to be able to speak clearly.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs much as possible, we should speak the words in layman&rsquo;s term.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes in an effort to impress the examiner, the student speaks high falluting words that the examiner is not able to relate to. This tends to make the examiner feel that they are not smart enough to be able to understand what the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; speaker is talking about. I have observed that books and novels that are best sellers are those that people from all walks of life can relate to.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Speed</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tBefore working on speed techniques on your speaking, you need to determine how fast you can talk. This will help you increase speed talking by making it easy to keep track of your progress. The average person can speak 50-100 words of fiction or non-technical topics per minute, but a fast speaking speed is between 100-150 words per minute. With a stopwatch, set the time for exactly one minute and speak at your regular pace. When the time is up, count the number of words you've spoken and you will know how fast you can speak.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe most common mistake students make is to trade speaking comprehension for speed. Sure, you've been able to increase speed talking, but speed speaking techniques are useless if people do not understand what you say. The trick to maintaining your level of comprehension is to adjust your speed according to the topic you are talking. Determine what kind of topic you are talking about and decide how fast you want to go. In general, speed up when you encounter familiar ideas, unnecessary explanations and examples, and restated ideas. Slow down when you come across unfamiliar terms, abstract concepts, or difficult sentences.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Opinions</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIf students want to speak with&nbsp; logic, they have to speak of facts. But they are also free to give their opinions about the whole thing. They can give illustrations to prove their point, or they can just simply state their reasons for having the said opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can even look at history and get their basis there. They can also consider the opinions of the majority of their classmates. They can gather some statistics, data or consensus to back up and support their opinions. In some cases, there are really no right or wrong answers, they are just a matter of differences of opinion. Thus, can give student extra scores in TOEFL IBT speaking test</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Tip</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAs a general rule in speaking, we are able to judge a person by the way he speaks. The common mistake student make is that they tend to speak without even thinking first. They answer in haste to a question thrown to them without even processing both the question and the answer. Many would agree that &ldquo;silent water runs deep.&rdquo; This means that people who talk less tend to speak with logic and authority than people who talk too much. Excellent answers for the test need not be lengthy, they can be short but they should be done with tact and really make a lot of sense.</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p98780/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p98780\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p729093/\">《权力的游戏》精讲 \"看\"的多样英文表达</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p729303/\">凯特王妃顺利诞下女婴 英国王室喜添新成员</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p728856/\">5种方法帮你改掉乱花钱的坏习惯</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p728950/\">测一测：你是哪种类型的吃货？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p728594/\">组图：世界最叹为观止的八大奇景</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p703118/\">英语四级作文万能句型背诵</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p728709/\">超法国！ 中国成为世界第二大酿酒葡萄产地</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p729106/\">万万想不到：电脑成厨王 出书分享原创食谱</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p726347/\">致我们终将逝去的天真（有声）</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p532552/\">免费在线学：CCTalk英语大厅课程表</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
