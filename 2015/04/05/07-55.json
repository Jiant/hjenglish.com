  "description": "<p>\n\t<strong>训练法一：背&ldquo;新概念&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMemorizing articles and vocabularies from New Concept English books is an excellent method to build up the basic foundation of a student. New concept one almost has 1000 vocabularies and is suitable for primary or middle school students.&nbsp; New concept two has 2500 to 3,000 vocabularies. A student will have at least collected 4,000 words after finishing studying these two books and it is already adequate to have a band score of 6 in IELTS Oral English</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>训练法二：找一些自己感兴趣的听力材料</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSearch for materials that you will be interested in such as comics and magazines. Students can try to read aloud the content to practice their Oral English. The sentences and vocabularies in these materials can be straightly used if a student would like to express similar idea or thinking of the same topic.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>训练法三：看美国电影</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tImitating how actors and actress deliver their lines in a movie is surely a good way to improve a student&rsquo;s Oral English. The scenes in the movie will allow students to know or guess what the actor/actress wants to relay. Plus , the students will not only learn how to say the sentences they learned from the movie but also the right expressions and intonations of them as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>训练法四：跟外国朋友交流</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tGet an English-speaking friend then communicate to him/her as much as you can. Make sure they&rsquo;re nice enough to repeat what they say if you do not understand them. Try to invite them to play basketball, baseball or whatever sports both of you are interested in. Make them part of your everyday life. If you talk to them a lot, it will really improve your listening and speaking skills.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>训练法五：熟悉固定句子结构和句型：</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tStudents should familiar themselves with the basic structure of sentences such as 1、主语&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;动词&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;表语. 2、主语&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;动词. 3、主语&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;动词&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;宾语4、主语&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;动词&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;宾语&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;宾语5、主语&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;动词&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;宾语&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;补语. On the other hand， phrases like ；enjoy doing sth ，be fond of doing sth，feel like doing sth ，be busy doing/with sth，carry sth with sb，see sb do/doing sth，hear sb do/doing sth，like doing/to do sth, would rather do sth should also be memorized to be able to improve the student&rsquo;s Oral English.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>训练法六：创造一个英语环境</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tTry to find some partners to practice your oral English. For example, your friends or classmates that are also interested in improving their speaking ability. If a student is having a difficulty to find one, English corner is a suitable place as it is where they can exchange English study experience, widen their sights and improve interest in English. If it&rsquo;s not easy to get English partners or having little chance to attend an English corner, then we have to create an English environment ourselves by speaking English to ourselves. For instance, you can talk to yourself about what you have seen or what you have done. This may sound crazy but it worked for a large amount of students.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>训练法七：听广播</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWhen listening to radio, students can review a lot of English usage such as vocabulary, grammatical structures, intonation and accent .Furthermore, they can learn new words and expressions by hearing them frequently in the radio. And general knowledge from news, features, or even advertising spots are certainly beneficial for regular listeners. And also, Listening to radio can be a good &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; while students do other things such as cooking, ironing, exercising, relaxing etc.</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p117672/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p117672\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p725879/\">囧研究：成功女人背后都有一个唠叨娘</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p725817/\">淘宝即视感：爆笑国外网购买家秀</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p725733/\">新闻讲解 《权力的游戏》作者弃新季剧本</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p103560/\">沪江英语资料下载帮助及沪元知识</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p725833/\">接受平凡的世界：平凡并快乐着</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p625263/\">吴彦祖美版《西游记》预告曝光！男神依旧</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p725782/\">5分钟的血月 本世纪最短月全食周六到来</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p725809/\">小杰伦来得太快！周董证实昆凌怀孕</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p535140/\">最失败全家福爆红网络 孩子飞出去了</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p725793/\">3岁天才儿童：IQ145会用5国语言算术</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
