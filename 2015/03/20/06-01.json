In fact, there are both advantages and disadvantages in X. Generally speaking, it is widely believed there are several positive aspects as follows. Firstly, _________________________. And secondly _________________________.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust As a popular saying goes, &quot;every coin has two sides&quot;, X is no exception, and in another word, it still has negative aspects. To begin with, _____________________. In addition, ______________________________.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo sum up, we should try to bring the advantages of X into full play, and reduce the disadvantages to the minimum at the same time. In that case, we will definitely make a better use of the X.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #f00;\"><strong>模板2<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tX now plays such an important part in so many people&rsquo;s lives that _____________________. Obviously, X has both advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs is often pointed out that, X makes us know ________________ so that __________________. In addition, _________________________. Yet here again, there is a danger. The main problem with it is that _______________________________. It is criticized on the grounds that it contributes to ______________________. Besides, _________________________.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn any case, whether the ultimate of X is good or not, one thing is certain that __________________. It is the uses to which it is put that determine its value to society.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #f00;\"><strong>模板3<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tX has many advantages. In the first place, ____________________________. Second, ___________________________. Third, ____________________________. For all these advantages, it is really worthwhile to _________________________________.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, just as everything has two sides, there are some disadvantages in _______________. The most serious problem is ________________________. Besides, __________________________.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, given an opportunity to ______________________, one must consider both sides of factors carefully before making up his mind. On the whole, it is a good thing to __________________, but on the other hand, one must not lose sight into for the advantages.</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p723784/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p723784\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723873/\">美版甄嬛传开播: 全民怒赞一丈红神翻译</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723946/\">外媒:快被橘子哥和马特的面基旅闪瞎了！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723957/\">知乎神回答:什么时候你觉得最孤独?</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723965/\">微软拼了:盗版用户也能免费升级Windows10</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723922/\">世界上最丑女人:拍励志纪录片反欺凌</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723933/\">埃菲尔铁塔不见了！法国也有雾霾</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723961/\">韩正赴沪江调研:你们充分体现了万众创新</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723951/\">我眼中的赫本闺蜜——世界礼仪皇后</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723294/\">囧研究: 男人不喜欢幽默的女生</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723858/\">腐国惊呼：淘宝的逆天脑洞我们跟不上！</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

Use specific reasons to develop your essay.</b></p>\n<p>\n\tMost of us can learn how to do something simple on our own with just a set of instructions. However, to learn about something more complex, it's always best to have a teacher.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n\tTeachers bring with them varied and useful backgrounds. They've been trained to teach individuals in different ways depending on their style. For instance, omen students learn better by discussing a topic. Others learn more by writing about it. Teachers can help students learn in the way that's best of each student. A textbook or a manual can only give you one way of learning something. Plus they're only as helpful as your ability to understand them. A good teacher can adapt her teaching to your needs.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n\tTeachers help you focus on what you're learning. If you're learning something by yourself, it&rsquo;s easy to become distracted, and go on to other activities. Teachers keep your attention on the subject. They also approach a subject logically, taking it one step at a time. On your own, it's tempting to skip parts of the learning process you think you don&rsquo;t need. That can binder your ability to really understand the subject.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n\tLearning a subject on your own is a very narrow way of learning. You can only use the information you get from the textbook. With a teacher, you get the information in the written materials as well as the teacher's own knowledge of the topic. Teachers can also provide extra materials to broaden the scope of what you're learning.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n\tThere's nothing wrong with studying on your own, and a learner can always benefit from some quiet study. For the best possible learning, though, a&nbsp; good teacher is the biggest help you can have.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>18 What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.</b></p>\n<p>\n\tEven though job situations can&nbsp; be very different, there are several qualities that all good supervisor have in common, A good boss treats all her employees fairly. She doesn't single out one employee for better(or worse)treatment than the others. A poor supervisor has favorites. Sometimes she'll even use her favorites to spy on&nbsp; other employees. She expects them to tell her what the others are saying about her. This can cause a lot of bad feeling among employees.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n\tA good supervisor gives clear and understandable directions. She doesn't constantly change her mind about what she wants employees to do. She also doesn't get angry with an employee who is confused and needs her to explain the directions again or more fully. Delegating authority well is another quality of a good supervisor. She knows how to use the skills of her employees to best advantage. A poor supervisor insists on doing everything herself. She is unwilling to give any authority to others.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n\tA good boss evaluates her employees on a reasonable ser of criteria, not on how she feels about them personally. And she lets the employees know what those criteria are, so they have a fair chance of meeting them.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe gives both praise and criticism in a straightforward manner. She also offers guidance when needed. A poor supervisor will criticize without giving any suggestions on how to improve.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n\tMost importantly, a good supervisor set the standards for her employee by her own behavior. She works hard and treats employees like valuable assets to the company. This promotes good morale among her workers, and this is of great benefit to her business.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">19 Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spends more money on improving public transportation ( buses, trains, subways)?
