Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</b></p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;If at first you don&rsquo;t succeed, try, try again.&rdquo; These are wise words. One should never give up. There is always another opportunity, another goal, or another option.</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce I ran for president of my class. Unfortunately, I lost. I lost because I did not promote myself enough. I looked at my mistakes and decided how to correct them. The following year, I ran for president again. This time I gave speeches, called voters on the phone, and banded out brochures. This time I won. Never give up. There is always another opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce I wanted to study medicine. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t like science. I failed all my science courses at school. Then I realized that what I liked about medicine was helping people. I changed my goal from healing people to helping people. Now, I&rsquo;m studying psychology. There is always another goal.</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce I wanted to talk with my friend. Unfortunately, his computer was down and I couldn&rsquo;t e-mail him. His phone line was busy so I couldn&rsquo;t call him. Mail would take too long so I couldn&rsquo;t write him. Since I really wanted to talk with him. I got on the bus and went across town to visit him. There is always another option.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you give up, you might as well die. My advice is to always look for another opportunity, another goal, or another option. There is always something else. Don&rsquo;t give up.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>42 AD Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, student nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly.
