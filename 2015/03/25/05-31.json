Use specific reasons to support your answer.</b></p>\n<p>\n\tI think it's probably true that people are never satisfied with what they have. They always want something more or something different from what is theirs. This just seems to be part of our human nature. Look at a toddler, Give her a toy to play with and she&rsquo; happy&mdash;until she sees something else. Then she wants that other toy to play with. If she and her brother are each given a cookie, she&rsquo;ll look to see whose cookie is bigger. She&rsquo;ll protest loudly if she thinks her brother is getting more.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The grass is always greener&rdquo; is an old expression, but it&rsquo;s a good expression of how many of us feel. We&rsquo;re always striving for a better job, a nicer place to live, a fancier car, or more expensive clothes. Part of this reaching for more and better is because we care about what other people think and want to impress them. Part of it is trying to make ourselves feel successful. But there&rsquo; also something in our nature that tells us we can do better and reach higher.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis isn&rsquo;t always a negative quality. There&rsquo;s another saying: &rdquo;A man&rsquo;s reach should excess his grasp. Or what&rsquo;s a heaven for?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a good thing to be constantly pushing ourselves and looking for something different. If we don&rsquo;t try for more and different things, we begin to stagnate, like a pool that doesn&rsquo;t get any fresh water.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem comes when we won&rsquo;t let ourselves be satisfied with anything we have. If we have a comfortable life and still feel as if something &lsquo;s missing, then we need to look inward. The something that&rsquo;s missing may be in our spirit.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>94 AD Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should read those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts. Use specific reasons and details to support your opinion.</b></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Important of Fiction</p>\n<p>\n\tHow could anyone suggest that people should only read about real events, real people, and established facts? For one thing, that means people wouldn&rsquo;t be reading half of all the great books that have ever been written, not to mention the plays, short stories and poetry. For another, it would mean that people&rsquo;s imaginations would not develop as children and would remain dulled throughout their lives.</p>\n<p>\n\tReading stories as a child helps develop our creativity by reaching us a lot about how to use words to create mental images. It open our world up, exposing us to other times and different ways of living. Reading histories of those times would serve kind of the same purpose, but it probably wouldn&rsquo;t stick in our minds as sharply. Reading an essay about poverty in Victorian England is not the same thing as reading in Charles Dicken&rsquo;s Oliver Twist. The images of a small boy being sold are more horrifying than simply reading the statement, &ldquo;children were sold into labor &ldquo;because a novel makes that small boy seem real to understanding fiction makes a more lasting impression on our minds and emotions.</p>\n<p>\n\tBesides, storytelling is an emotional need for human beings. From earliest times, humans have taught their children about life, not by telling them facts and figures, but by telling them stories. Some of these stories show what people are like (human nature),and help us experience a wide range of feelings. Some make us think about how we should act. Telling a child that it&rsquo;s wrong to lie will make little impression, but telling him the story of a little boy whose grows longer every time be tell a lie will make a big impression.</p>\n<p>\n\tFiction is too important to our culture, our minds, and our emotions. How could we ever give it up?</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" id=\"editorA4style2\" style=\"border: 1px dotted rgb(255, 165, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(255, 140, 0);\">考好托福 去美国留学啦！</span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/7446/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/201002/201002051430571921.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/7131/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/201003/201003025243096352.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/6575/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/200909/200909243171546915.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/5218/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/200905/200905132304915319.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://chat.53kf.com/company.php?arg=hjbook&amp;style=1\" title=\"\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/2009/images/btn_kechengzixun.gif\" /></a></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p102675/page2/\">点击查看第二页</a><br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p102675/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p102675\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p724433/\">国外知乎:你读过最深刻英文格言是？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p724524/\">全球审美差异: 什么样才算美男子？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723865/\">不知不觉变胖子: 你一天吃了多少糖？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p724538/\">“泰迪脸”萌物20年后再现天山</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p570254/\">破产姐妹笔记123：劈腿英文怎么说</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p724407/\">如何精通多国语言 李光耀的5大学习心得</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p724528/\">投简历有窍门: 你真的用对了邮箱吗？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p724419/\">今天的你是什么发型？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p700976/\">11个iPhone仍无法超越安卓的功能 </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p448896/\">谁说学语言枯燥：5种有趣的方式英语学起来！</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
