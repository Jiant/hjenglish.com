His absence had fuelled rumours he was ill, had been <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/overthrow\" target=\"_blank\">overthrown</a> by the army or had even flown abroad to attend the birth of a love child.今年已经62岁的普京在圣彼得堡市市郊的康斯坦丁宫与吉尔吉斯斯坦总统会晤，这是普京自3月5日后的首次露面。在普京消失期间有关他的各种谣言满天飞：生病、被军队赶下台、新添了一个孩子等。</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;It would be boring without gossip,&quot; Putin said, smiling easily before television cameras. He looked relaxed, if pale.&ldquo;如果没有八卦，我们会觉得很无聊的。&rdquo;面对镜头普京笑称。他看起来很轻松。</p>\n<p>\n\tHis spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, mocked the press for its interest, referring sarcastically to the various rumours: &quot;So you've seen the broken, <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/paralysed\" target=\"_blank\">paralysed</a> president, who has been captured by generals? He's only just flown in from Switzerland, where he attended a birth as you know.&quot;普京的发言人德米特里&middot;佩斯科夫在网上发布了一段话，通过引用各种传言讽刺了媒体：&ldquo;现在你们终于看到那个健康状况不佳的总统了吧，他之前不是被军队抓起来了么？其实他只是刚从瑞士飞回来，他刚添了个孩子这事你们不都知道了么！&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a choreographed double-act, Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/vouch\" target=\"_blank\">vouched</a> for the Russian leader's health, saying that Putin &quot;just now drove me around the grounds; he himself sat at the wheel.&quot;吉尔吉斯斯坦总统阿坦巴耶夫也间接澄清了普京的健康谣言。他说，在两人举行会晤前，普京&ldquo;还亲自坐上驾驶席，开车带着我到处转转&rdquo;。</p>\n<p>\n\tPutin's return to public view coincided with Russia's biggest military exercises since ties with the West sank to a post-Cold War low over the Ukraine crisis.普京的重新回归恰好迎来了俄罗斯最大的军事演习，自从乌克兰危机之后俄罗斯同西方的关系降到了冷战后的水平。</p>\n<p>\n\tDefence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Putin had ordered nearly 40,000 troops to be at combat readiness for exercises in Russia's Arctic North and elsewhere, which appeared meant to <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/dwarf\" target=\"_blank\">dwarf</a> war games in neighbouring NATO-member Norway.俄国防部长谢尔盖&middot;绍伊古称，普京已经下令，近4万名军人已在北极圈北部及其他地方做好了演习的各种准备，这让俄罗斯的邻国&mdash;北约成员国挪威的军事演习规模相形见绌。</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Russian leader prides himself on his <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/macho\" target=\"_blank\">macho</a> image. In 2008 he said he worked like a &quot;galley slave&quot; to run Russia. Typically, he is shown most days on state-controlled television, meeting officials in Moscow or travelling to Russia's far-flung regions.普京总统一直以自己的英汉形象为骄傲。2008年他曾说他像一名苦役一样为俄罗斯工作。确实，他经常数天出现在国家电视台中，不是在莫斯科接见官员就是在俄罗斯的辽阔土地上奔波。</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring his absence, the Kremlin unexpectedly cancelled a trip to Kazakhstan and a high profile meeting with officers of the main successor agency to the KGB. Pictures were posted on the Kremlin website of meetings Putin had with public figures, which, it later emerged, had been taken several days earlier.普京消失期间，克里姆林宫意外地取消了其访问哈萨克斯坦的行程，以及会见克格勃继任人员的会议。克里姆林宫的官网上出现的都是普京之前一些活动的照片。</p>\n<p>\n\tThroughout his absence Russian officials had said that Putin had been working. Peskov said he had answered &quot;10 times over&quot; what Putin was doing during his absence. &quot;It is impossible to say anymore,&quot; he said.俄官方人员称&ldquo;失踪&rdquo;期间普京一直都在工作。佩斯科夫说有关&ldquo;普京失踪期间到底在干什么&rdquo;的问题他已经回答了十余次了。&ldquo;其他的确实无可奉告。&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe military exercises are due to last for much of the week, during which Russia will celebrate the anniversary of its <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/annexation\" target=\"_blank\">annexation</a> of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula.俄罗斯本次的军事演习会持续几周时间，这期间俄罗斯还会庆祝兼并乌克兰克里米亚半岛纪念日。</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p723786/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p723786\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723464/\">听英乐学英语:《暮光之城》插曲学习笔记</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723686/\">像总统那样读书: 奥巴马最爱的8本小说</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723636/\">2015两会政府工作报告 10个英文新词精析 </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723668/\">2015两会 李克强答记者问双语全文</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p593264/\">生活很心酸？8招支撑你度过困难时期</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723662/\">导演李晓自尽: 追忆那些年自杀的欧美艺人</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p617581/\">社会学家给毕业生们的忠告：不要担心梦想</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723572/\">无法忍受噪音的你可能是个天才</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p621905/\">世界最小西瓜萌翻网友 一口一个嘎嘣脆</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p722197/\">组图: 全世界人民的午餐都吃什么？</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

A Review of the Work in 2014 </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t过去一年，我国发展面临的国际国内环境复杂严峻。全球经济复苏艰难曲折，主要经济体走势分化。国内经济下行压力持续加大，多重困难和挑战相互交织。</p>\n<p>\n\tOver the past year, the international and domestic environments faced by China in its development have been complicated and challenging. The road to global economic recovery has been rough, with many ups and downs, and the performance of the major economies has been divergent. Downward pressure on China's economy has continued to mount, and we have faced an array of interwoven difficulties and challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\t在以习近平同志为总书记的党中央坚强领导下，全国各族人民万众一心，克难攻坚，完成了全年经济社会发展主要目标任务，全面深化改革实现良好开局，全面推进依法治国开启新征程，全面建成小康社会又迈出坚实步伐。</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, under the firm leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) headed by General Secretary Xi Jinping, all our people have worked together as one, surmounted difficulties, and accomplished the year's main targets for economic and social development, thereby ensuring that we got off to a good start in comprehensively deepening reform, embarked on a new journey to fully advance the law-based governance of China, and again made solid progress in our endeavor to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects.</p>\n<p>\n\t一年来，我国经济社会发展总体平稳，稳中有进。&ldquo;稳&rdquo;的主要标志是，经济运行处于合理区间。</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the past year, China has, overall, achieved a stable performance while at the same time securing progress in its economic and social development. The main indication of this stable performance is that the economy operated within an appropriate range.</p>\n<p>\n\t增速稳，国内生产总值达到63.6万亿元，比上年增长7.4%，在世界主要经济体中名列前茅。</p>\n<p>\n\t--The growth rate was steady. China's GDP reached 63.6 trillion yuan, an increase of 7.4% over the previous year, making China one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t就业稳，城镇新增就业1322万人，高于上年。</p>\n<p>\n\t--Employment remained robust, with 13.22 million new urban jobs created, which is higher than the figure for the previous year.</p>\n<p>\n\t价格稳，居民消费价格上涨2%。&ldquo;进&rdquo;的总体特征是，发展的协调性和可持续性增强。</p>\n<p>\n\t--Prices were stable, with the CPI rising by 2%. The underlying feature demonstrating progress is that our development is becoming better coordinated and more sustainable.</p>\n<p>\n\t经济结构有新的优化，粮食产量达到1.21万亿斤，消费对经济增长的贡献率上升3个百分点，达到51.2%，服务业增加值比重由46.9%提高到48.2%，新产业、新业态、新商业模式不断涌现。</p>\n<p>\n\t--The economic structure was upgraded. Grain output reached 605 million metric tons; the contribution of consumption toward economic growth rose by three percentage points to 51.2%; the value added of the service sector increased from 46.9% to 48.2% of the GDP; and there was a constant stream of new industries, new types of business, and new business models. The central and western regions grew faster in economic terms than the eastern region.</p>\n<p>\n\t中西部地区经济增速快于东部地区。发展质量有新的提升，一般公共预算收入增长8.6%，研究与试验发展经费支出与国内生产总值之比超过2%，能耗强度下降4.8%，是近年来最大降幅。</p>\n<p>\n\t--The quality of development was raised. Revenue in the general public budgets grew by 8.6%. Research and development spending accounted for more than 2% of the GDP. Energy intensity was cut by 4.8%, the biggest reduction made in recent years.</p>\n<p>\n\t人民生活有新的改善，全国居民人均可支配收入实际增长8%，快于经济增长；农村居民人均可支配收入实际增长9.2%，快于城镇居民收入增长；农村贫困人口减少1232万人；6600多万农村人口饮水安全问题得到解决；出境旅游超过1亿人次。</p>\n<p>\n\t--People's lives were improved. Per capita disposable personal income increased by 8% in real terms nationwide, growing faster than the economy, and the per capita disposable income of rural residents grew by 9.2%, outpacing that of those living in urban areas. In rural areas, the number of people living in poverty was reduced by 12.32 million, and over 66 million more people gained access to safe drinking water. The number of outbound trips made by Chinese tourists exceeded 100 million.</p>\n<p>\n\t改革开放有新的突破，全面深化改革系列重点任务启动实施，本届政府减少1/3行政审批事项的目标提前实现。</p>\n<p>\n\t--New breakthroughs were made in reform and opening up. A series of key tasks for comprehensively deepening reform were launched, and the goal of the current administration to cut the number of items that require government review by one third was achieved ahead of schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\t这份成绩单的确来之不易，它凝聚着全国各族人民的心血和汗水，坚定了我们奋勇前行的决心和信心。</p>\n<p>\n\tThese achievements have not come easily. They have been made possible by the painstaking efforts and hard work of all our people, and they have strengthened our resolve and confidence to keep pushing ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t过去一年，困难和挑战比预想的大。我们迎难而上，主要做了以下工作。</p>\n<p>\n\tOver the past year, we have faced more difficulties and challenges than anticipated. We have risen to the challenge and accomplished the following in our work.</p>\n<p>\n\t一是在区间调控基础上实施定向调控，保持经济稳定增长。</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, on the basis of range-based macro regulation, we exercised targeted regulation to keep the economy growing steadily.</p>\n<p>\n\t面对经济下行压力加大态势，我们保持战略定力，稳定宏观经济政策，没有采取短期强刺激措施，而是继续创新宏观调控思路和方式，实行定向调控，激活力、补短板、强实体。把握经济运行合理区间的上下限，抓住发展中的突出矛盾和结构性问题，定向施策，聚焦靶心，精准发力。向促改革要动力，向调结构要助力，向惠民生要潜力，既扩大市场需求，又增加有效供给，努力做到结构调优而不失速。</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the face of mounting downward economic pressure, we maintained strategic focus and kept our macroeconomic policy unchanged. Instead of using short-term stimulus measures, we continued to develop new ideas and methods for macro regulation. We exercised targeted regulation, stimulated market activity, shored up our weak spots, and boosted the real economy. With a keen understanding of the appropriate range within which the economy needs to be operating, we adopted targeted steps to address the serious issues and structural problems hindering development. We promoted reform to gain impetus for development, made structural adjustments to produce support for development, and improved living standards to increase the potential for development. We both expanded market demand and increased effective supply, working to ensure that structural adjustments were made without compromising the growth rate.</p>\n<p>\n\t有效实施积极的财政政策和稳健的货币政策。实行定向减税和普遍性降费，拓宽小微企业税收优惠政策范围，扩大&ldquo;营改增&rdquo;试点。加快财政支出进度，积极盘活存量资金。</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have been effectively implementing proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy. We increased targeted tax reductions, reduced fees across the board, extended the coverage of tax relief policies to benefit more small and micro businesses, and expanded the trials to replace business tax with VAT to cover more industries.</p>\n<p>\n\t灵活运用货币政策工具，采取定向降准、定向再贷款、非对称降息等措施，加大对经济社会发展薄弱环节的支持力度，小微企业、&ldquo;三农&rdquo;贷款增速比各项贷款平均增速分别高4.2和0.7个百分点。同时，完善金融监管，坚决守住不发生区域性系统性风险的底线。</p>\n<p>\n\tWe sped up the process of making budgetary funds available for fiscal expenditures and put surplus budgetary funds to good use. By flexibly utilizing monetary policy instruments, making targeted cuts to required reserve ratios, carrying out targeted re-lending, and making asymmetric interest rate cuts, we stepped up support for weaker areas in economic and social development. Increases in loans made to small and micro businesses, and loans for agriculture, rural areas, and farmers, outdid the average increase in loans overall by 4.2 and 0.7 percentage points respectively. At the same time, regulation of the financial sector was improved and regional and systemic risks were forestalled.</p>\n<p>\n\t二是深化改革开放，激发经济社会发展活力。</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond, we deepened reform and opening up and invigorated economic and social development.</p>\n<p>\n\t针对束缚发展的体制机制障碍，我们通过全面深化改革，以释放市场活力对冲经济下行压力，啃了不少硬骨头，经济、政治、文化、社会、生态文明等体制改革全面推进。</p>\n<p>\n\tTo address obstructions holding back development caused by certain systems and mechanisms, we comprehensively deepened reform, invigorating the market to offset downward economic pressure. We tackled many tough issues and carried out structural reforms in the economic, political, cultural, societal, and ecological sectors.</p>\n<p>\n\t扎实推动重点改革。制定并实施深化财税体制改革总体方案，预算管理制度和税制改革取得重要进展，专项转移支付项目比上年减少1/3以上，一般性转移支付比重增加，地方政府性债务管理得到加强。存款利率和汇率浮动区间扩大，民营银行试点迈出新步伐，&ldquo;沪港通&rdquo;试点启动，外汇储备、保险资金运用范围拓展。能源、交通、环保、通信等领域价格改革加快。启动科技资金管理、考试招生、户籍、机关事业单位养老保险制度等改革。</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have made solid progress in key reforms. We formulated and implemented a coordinated plan for deepening the reform of the fiscal and tax systems. Important progress was made in the reform of the budgetary management and tax systems. The number of items receiving special transfer payments was over one third less than that of the previous year, and the proportion of transfer payments for general purposes was increased. Management of local government debt was strengthened. The floating ranges of interest rates on deposits and exchange rates were expanded. New steps were taken in the trials to establish private banks. The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched on a trial basis. The scope for using foreign exchange reserves and insurance funds was broadened. Price reforms in energy, transport, environmental protection, and communications were accelerated. We launched reforms to the system for managing research and development funding, the school examination and enrollment systems, the household registration system, and the pension system for employees of Party and government offices and public institutions.</p>\n<p>\n\t继续把简政放权、放管结合作为改革的重头戏。国务院各部门全年取消和下放246项行政审批事项，取消评比达标表彰项目29项、职业资格许可和认定事项149 项，再次修订投资项目核准目录，大幅缩减核准范围。着力改革商事制度，新登记注册市场主体达到1293万户，其中新登记注册企业增长45.9%，形成新的创业热潮。经济增速放缓，新增就业不降反增，显示了改革的巨大威力和市场的无限潜力。</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have continued to give the central stage in reform to streamlining administration and delegating more powers to lower-level governments and to society in general while improving regulation. Over the course of the year, departments under the State Council cancelled the requirement of or delegated the power for review on 246 items. We cancelled 29 performance evaluations, inspections on the meeting of standards, and commendations, and 149 verifications and approvals of vocational qualifications. We again revised and significantly shortened the list of investment projects requiring government review. We channeled great effort into the reform of the business system. The number of newly registered market entities reached 12.93 million, with that of enterprises increasing by 45.9%, creating a fresh surge of entrepreneurial activity. While economic growth slowed down,more jobs were created, which fully demonstrates both the tremendous power of reform and the endless potential of the market.</p>\n<p>\n\t以开放促改革促发展。扩展上海自由贸易试验区范围，新设广东、天津、福建自由贸易试验区。稳定出口，增加进口，出口占国际市场份额继续提升。实际使用外商直接投资1196亿美元，居世界首位。对外直接投资1029亿美元，与利用外资并驾齐驱。中国与冰岛、瑞士自贸区启动实施，中韩、中澳自贸区完成实质性谈判。铁路、电力、油气、通信等领域对外合作取得重要成果，中国装备正大步走向世界。</p>\n<p>\n\tWe drew on further opening up to boost reform and development. We expanded the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone and established similar zones in Guangdong, Tianjin, and Fujian. We worked to keep exports stable and increase imports, and China's international market share in exports continued to increase. Foreign direct investment actually made in China reached $119.6 billion, making the country the world's top destination for foreign direct investment. China's outward foreign direct investment reached $102.9 billion, meaning that outward investment has come to draw even with inward investment. China's free trade zone arrangements with Iceland and Switzerland were officially launched, and China completed substantive talks on free trade zones with the Republic of Korea and Australia. Major progress was made in cooperation with other countries in fields such as railways, electric power, oil, natural gas, and communications. Chinese equipment is making significant strides into the international market.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p723767/page2/\">点击查看第二页</a><br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p723767/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p723767\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723464/\">听英乐学英语:《暮光之城》插曲学习笔记</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723686/\">像总统那样读书: 奥巴马最爱的8本小说</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723636/\">2015两会政府工作报告 10个英文新词精析 </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723668/\">2015两会 李克强答记者问双语全文</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p593264/\">生活很心酸？8招支撑你度过困难时期</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723662/\">导演李晓自尽: 追忆那些年自杀的欧美艺人</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p617581/\">社会学家给毕业生们的忠告：不要担心梦想</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p723572/\">无法忍受噪音的你可能是个天才</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p621905/\">世界最小西瓜萌翻网友 一口一个嘎嘣脆</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p722197/\">组图: 全世界人民的午餐都吃什么？</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
