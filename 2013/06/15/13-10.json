Nowadays, with the explosion of population and boom of economy, human&rsquo;s relentless exploitation of natural resources has caused crisis of exhaustion of energy and resources. The remark &ldquo;Earth provides enough to satisfy every man&rsquo;s needs, but not every man&rsquo;s greed.&rdquo; gives out a warning for us all.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe ecosystem has remained balanced until man becomes obsessed with their ambition to conquer Nature and they are blinded by greed. On one hand, they are so economy-oriented that they ignore the protection of environment. Increasing pollution not only causes serious problems such as global warming but also could threaten to end human life on our planet. On the other hand, man exploits and abuses non-renewable energy and resources for the sake of developing economy. If man insists on extracting natural resources recklessly, it will be too dreadful to face the consequence.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet us remember that only when we shake off greed and heal the earth can we build a better home for ourselves and our future generations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p438371/?source=1059\" target=\"_blank\">名师指点，一个暑假搞定四六级&gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p488474/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p488474\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p488259/\">2013年6月大学英语四六级作文预测</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p488258/\">2013年6月大学英语四六级作文预测之择业问题</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p488024/\">2013年6月大学英语四级六级作文中一定能用到的100个句子</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p488334/\">2013年6月英语四级真题听力原文完整版（沪江网校版）</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p486754/\">2013年6月英语四级六级多题多卷提示：作文题目在试题册背面</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p488341/\">2013年6月英语四级真题及答案汇总</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p488347/\">2013年6月四级作文图画题难倒考生：我根本没看懂！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p488314/\">四六级图画图表作文模板</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p488399/\">2013年6月英语四级快速阅读答案及解析第一套（沪江网校版）</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p486483/\">2013年6月英语四级成绩查询与六级成绩查询短信提醒开通</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

Although it&rsquo;s often assumed musical ability us inherited, there&rsquo;s abundant evidence that this isn&rsquo;t the case. While it seems that at birth virtually everyone has perfect pitch, the reasons that one child is better than another are motivation and practice.</p>\n<p>\n\tHighly musical children were sung to more as infants and more encouraged to join in song games as kids than less musical ones, long before any musical ability could have been evident. Studies of classical musicians prove that the best ones practiced considerably more from childhood onwards than ordinary orchestral players, and this is because their parents were at them to put in the hours from a very young age.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe same was true of children selected for entry to specialist music schools, compared with those who were rejected. The chosen children had parents who had very actively supervised music lessons and daily practice from young ages, giving up substantial periods of leisure time to take the children to lessons and concerts.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe singer Michael Jackson&rsquo;s story, although unusually brutal and extreme, is illumination when considering musical prodigy(天才). Accounts suggest that he was subjected to cruel beatings and emotional torture ,and that he was <em>humiliated</em> (羞辱) constantly by his father, What sets Jackson&rsquo;s family apart is that his father used his reign of terror to train his children as musicians and dancers.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn top of his extra ability Michael also had more drive. This may have been the result of being the closest of his brothers and sisters to his mother. &ldquo;He seemed different to me from the other children &mdash;special,&rdquo;Michael&rsquo;s mother said of him. She may not have realized that treating her son as special may have been part of the reason be became like that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll in all, if you want to bring up a Mozart or Bach, the key factor is how hard you are prepared to crack the whip. Thankfully, most of us will probably settle for a bit of fun on the recorder and some ill-executed pieces of music-on the piano from our children.</p>\n<p>\n\t注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。</p>\n<p>\n\t47．According to the author, a child&rsquo;s musical ability has much to do with their &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;\">48. &nbsp;In order to develop the musical ability of their children, many parents will accompany them during their practice sacrificing a lot of then own &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;\">49.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on <strong>Answer Sheet 2</strong> with a single line through the centre.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;\">Passage One</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Questions 52 to 56 are based pm the following passage.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;\">In 2011, many shoppers chose to avoid the frantic crowds and do their holiday shopping from the comfort of their computer. Sales at online retailers gained by more than 15%, making it the biggest season ever. But people are also returning those purchases at record rates, up 8% from last year.</span></p>\n<p>\n\tWhat went wrong? Is the lingering shadow of the global financial crisis making it harder to accept extravagant indulgences? Or that people shop more impulsively&mdash;and therefore make bad decisions&mdash;when online? Both arguments are plausible. However, there is a third factor: a question of touch. We can love the look but, in an online environment, we cannot feel the quality of a texture, the shape of the fit, the fall of a fold or, for that matter, the weight of an earring. And physically interacting with an object makes you more committed to your purchase.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen my most recent book <em>Brandwashed </em>was released, I teamed up with a local bookstore to conduct an experiment about the difference between the online and offline shopping experience. I carefully instructed a group of volunteers to promote my book in two different ways. The first was a fairly hands-off approach. Whenever a customer would inquire about my book, the volunteer would take them over to the shelf and point to it. Out of 20 such requests, six customers proceeded with the purchase.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second option also involved going over to the shelf but, this time, removing the book and them subtly holding onto it for just an extra moment before placing it in the customer&rsquo;s hands. Of the 20 people who were handed the book, 13 ended up buying it. Just physically passing the book showed a big difference in sales. Why? We feel something similar to a sense of ownership when we hold things in our hand. That&rsquo;s why we establish or reestablish connection by greeting strangers and friends with a handshake. In this case, having to then let go of the book after holding it might generate a subtle sense of loss, and motivate us to make the purchase even more.</p>\n<p>\n\tA recent study also revealed the power of touch, in this case when it came to conventional mail. A deeper and longer-lasting impression of a message was formed when delivered in a letter, as opposed to receiving the same message online. Brain imaging showed that, on touching the paper, the emotional center of the brain was activated, thus forming a stronger bond.

A hot, dry summer has triggered another flood of such claims. And, while many interests are at work, one of the players that benefits the most from this story are the media: the notion of &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; climate simply makes for more compelling news.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsider Paul Krugman writing breathlessly in the <em>New York Times </em>about the &ldquo;rising incidence of extreme events,&rdquo; He claims that global warming caused the current drought in America&rsquo;s Midwest, and that supposedly record-high corn prices could cause a global food crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the United Nations climate panel&rsquo;s latest assessment tells us precisely the opposite. For &ldquo;North America there is medium confidence that there has an overall slight tendency toward less dryness&rdquo; Moreover, there is no way that Krugman could have identified this drought as being caused by global warming without a time machine; Climate models estimate that such detection will be possible by 2048, at the earliest.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, fortunately, this year&rsquo;s drought appears unlikely to cause a food crisis, as global rice and wheat supplies retain plentiful. Moreover, Krugman overlooks inflation: Prices have increased six-fold since 1969. so, while com futures(期货) did set a record of about S8 per bushel(葡式耳)in late July, the inflation-adjusted price of corn was higher throughout most of the 1970s, reaching 516 in1974.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, Krugman conveniently forgets that concerns about global warming are the main reason that corn prices have skyrocketed since 2005. Nowadays 40 percent of corn grown in the United States is used to produce ethanol（乙醇）,which does absolutely nothing for the climate, but certainly distorts the price of corn&mdash;at the expense of many of the world&rsquo;s poorest people.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tBill Mickbben similarly worries in <em>The Guardian</em> about the Midwest drought and corn prices. He confidently tells us that raging wildfires from New Mexico and Colorado to Siberia are &ldquo;exactly&rdquo; what the early stages of global warming look like.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the latest overview of global wildfire suggests that fire intensity has declined over the past 70 years and is now close to its preindustrial level.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp; When well-meaning campaigners want us to pay attention to global warming, they often end up pitching beyond the facts. And, while this may seem justified by a noble goal, such &ldquo;policy by people&rdquo; tactics rarely work, and often backfire.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp; Remember how, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Al Gore claimed that we were in store for ever more destructive hurricanes? Since then, hurricane incidence has dropped off the charts. Exaggerated claims merely fuel public distrust and disengagement.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; That is unfortunate, because global warming is a real problem, and we do need to address it.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>注意：此部分试题请在答题卡</strong><strong>2</strong><strong>上作答。</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t57. In what way do the media benefit from extreme weather?</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; A) They can attract people&rsquo;s attention to their reports.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; B) They can choose from a greater variety of topics.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; C) They can make themselves better known.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; D) They can give voice to different views.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;\">58.

What is the chief reason for the rise in corn prices according to the author?</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp; A) Demand for food has been rising in the developing countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; B) A considerable portion of corn is used to produce green fuel.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Climate change has caused corn yields to drop markedly.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; D) Inflation rates have been skyrocketing since the 1970s.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t60.

Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn most cultures throughout the world, there is an expectation that when a person reaches adulthood, marriage should soon follow. In the United States <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;62 &nbsp;</u>，each month upwards of 168,000 couples wed,&nbsp; <u>63&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>to love, honor, and respect their chosen life mates <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;64&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>death parts them. The expectation is deep-rooted.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp; <u>&nbsp;65&nbsp; </u>&nbsp;the social functions, purposes, and relevance of marriage are rapidly changing in <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;66&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>society, making them less clear-cut than they have been<u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 67&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>history. For instance, in a Pew Research Center random polling of over 2,000 <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;68&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>fewer than half of all of the adults polled indicated that <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;69&nbsp; </u>&nbsp;a man and a woman plan to spend the&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>70&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>of their lives together as a couple, it was important than <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;71 </u>&nbsp;&nbsp;marry.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose of us who choose to marry have <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;72&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>reasons why we decide to marry the person we do. There is a <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;72&nbsp; </u>, however in our Western, individualistic culture: We tend to marry for reasons that benefit ourselves, &nbsp;<u>74&nbsp; </u>for reasons that benefit the society <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;75&nbsp; </u>, such as found in collectivist cultures. Research in Western cultures has found, for example, that the number-one <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;76&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>people cite for marrying to signify a lifelong commitment <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;77 </u>someone they love. However, this reason is not the only response to why people wed&mdash;today, people get married for reasons of commitment, security, and personal belief systems. The Pew Research Center&rsquo;s recent findings<u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 78 </u>&nbsp;&nbsp;that the main reasons people get married are for&nbsp; <u>&nbsp;79&nbsp; &nbsp;</u>&nbsp;happiness and commitment, and bearing and missing children. As the date from this <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;80&nbsp; </u>&nbsp;show us, there are racial, age, and religious differences in what people<u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 81&nbsp; </u>&nbsp;to be the main purposes of getting married.</p>\n<p>\n\t62.
