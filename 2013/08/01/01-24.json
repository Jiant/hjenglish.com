All our Super Centers and Main Centers have been extensively investigated during the winter season 1975-1976. As a result we have first-hand information on the way in which hotels, life networks and ski schools, etc. Operate during the season. We have not been able to investigate, at first hand, all our Independent Centers during the last season but all have been visited during the past three seasons. Should you need any more information about these centers we will try to get it for you. Our American centers have been investigated on our behalf by United Airlines Tours Department and by the U. S. tour operators who are assisting United and ourselves to offer you this novel program to the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhere possible we have eliminated the use of superlatives from the text (possibly making our brochure小册子 less attractive to read than it might be) and have concentrated on as accurate a description as possible. Nevertheless you should bear in mind that your opinion and the opinion of our investigator might differ and there may be changes between the time of a visit by our investigator and the visit of one of our customers.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe trust that it is evident to you that we have done all in our power to eliminate misdescription and that there really is no question of misrepresenta-tion on our part&mdash;either careless or otherwise. We welcome your constructive criticism&mdash;it is the best way we know of improving our brochures and our service. Although complaints are very expensive to handle, your complaint or criticism will be thoroughly investigated and a refund (退赔) made if it is justified&mdash;none will be made if it isn't.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>26.</strong> The firm claims that all its winter sports centers have been the recent target of&nbsp;_______.</p>\n<p>\n\tA. a program of personal visits</p>\n<p>\n\tB. intensive enquiries about facilities</p>\n<p>\n\tC. attempts to increase hotel accommodation</p>\n<p>\n\tD. an improved information service</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>27. </strong>The &quot;Independent Centers&quot; were personally inspected_______.</p>\n<p>\n\tA. the year before last B. three years ago</p>\n<p>\n\tC. between 1975 and 1976 D. within the last three seasons</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>28.</strong> The program of tours to the United States appears to be_______.</p>\n<p>\n\tA. a new collaboration with U.
