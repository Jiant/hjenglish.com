The 21st Century Council is a world renowned think tank whose members are of international prominence. At the outset, I wish to extend warm congratulations on the convocation of this conference in Beijing and a warm welcome to all the distinguished guests.</p>\n<p>\n\t这次会议的主题是&ldquo;读懂中国&rdquo;，这不仅体现了21世纪理事会对中国的关注，也在一定程度上反映出国际社会希望更深入地了解中国。这一主题具有重要的现实意义，有助于增进中外之间的相互理解与信任。中方对此次会议十分重视。今天下午，习近平主席将会见与会代表。昨天，李克强总理在会议开幕式上致辞。我想借此机会，就中国的外交政策谈几点看法，供各位参考。The theme of this conference, &quot;Understanding China&quot;, reflects not only the Council's keen interest in China, but also, to some extent, the desire of the international community to have a deeper understanding of China. It is highly relevant and will contribute to the mutual understanding and trust between China and the rest of the world. The Chinese side places high importance on this conference. This afternoon, President Xi Jinping will meet with the representatives of conference participants. Yesterday, Premier Li Keqiang delivered a speech at the opening ceremony. Now let me take this opportunity to share with you my views on China's foreign policy.</p>\n<p>\n\t要&ldquo;读懂中国&rdquo;，需要把中国放在世界发展的大背景下观察。当今世界正在发生深刻复杂的变化，呈现出一些不同于以往的新特点、新动向、新趋势，其中以下三个方面最为突出：In order to understand China, one needs to view China in the larger context of the development of the world. The world is undergoing profound and complex changes with new features, developments and trends that are quite different from past experience. I wish to touch upon three most salient features.</p>\n<p>\n\t当今世界，是一个发展日新月异的世界。一大批新兴市场国家和发展中国家走上发展的快车道，全球30多亿人正在同步推进工业化并分享现代化成果，有力推动人类进步事业向更高层次迈进。科学技术突飞猛进，世界正处在新一轮科技革命的前夜，新的增长点正在孕育。尽管国际金融危机的深层次影响还在继续显现，但世界大发展的态势没有停滞、更不会逆转。各国普遍将谋发展置于各自内外政策的重要位置，如何实现更好发展日益成为牵动国际关系的重要因素。Today's world is one of rapid development. Many emerging markets and developing countries have embarked on the fast track of development. More than three billion people across the world are pursuing industrialization simultaneously and sharing the benefits of modernization, effectively elevating the cause of human progress to a higher level. With rapid advancement in science and technology, the world is on the eve of a new round of scientific and technological revolution with new growth areas being created. Despite the lingering profound impacts of the international financial crisis, the world has not stopped pursuing development, still less will this course be reversed. It has become a common practice for countries to place development high on their domestic and foreign policy agenda. To realize development of higher quality has become an increasingly important factor in international relations.</p>\n<p>\n\t当今世界，是一个变革潮流更为强劲的世界。国际力量对比更趋均衡，国际体系酝酿深刻变革，新兴市场和发展中国家在国际事务中的代表性和话语权得到提升，二十国集团等全球治理机制逐步成型并不断完善。事实表明，世界上没有任何一种发展模式可以放之四海而皆准。我们应当与时俱进，积极探索并不断完善符合自身国情的发展道路，循序渐进推动国际体系调整变革。Today's world is one of reform with growing momentum. The international balance of power is moving towards greater equilibrium. Deep changes are brewing in the international system. The representation and voice of emerging markets and developing countries in international affairs have been raised. Mechanisms of global governance such as the G20 have gradually taken shape and are steadily improving. What has happened shows that there is no such thing as a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; development model in the world. We must keep abreast of the times, actively explore and improve development paths suited to our respective national conditions and pursue incremental progress in adjusting and reforming the international system.</p>\n<p>\n\t当今世界，是一个合作不断深入的世界。随着经济全球化的进一步发展，各国相互依存达到前所未有的广度和深度，彼此利益交融、兴衰相伴、安危与共。面对层出不穷的经济金融问题、此起彼伏的国际地区热点和日益增多的全球性挑战，没有哪个国家可以独善其身，携手合作、同舟共济成为各国必然选择。以合作求和平、以合作促发展、以合作谋安全越来越成为国际关系的主流和大势。Today's world is one of deepening cooperation. As economic globalization gathers pace, interdependence among countries has reached unprecedented levels in both breadth and depth. With our interests so intertwined, we rise and fall together. And there is either security for all or security for none. Facing a host of economic and financial issues, various international and regional hotspots and a growing number of global challenges, no country can stay unscathed. Pulling together like passengers in the same boat has become the one and only option for all countries. To achieve peace, development and security through cooperation is becoming a central theme and major trend of international relations.</p>\n<p>\n\t当今世界处于格局演变的重要阶段，当代中国处于民族复兴的关键时期。中国的前途命运同世界的前途命运紧密相连。在以习近平同志为总书记的党中央领导下，中国对未来发展作出了战略部署，明确了&ldquo;两个一百年&rdquo;的奋斗目标，即到2020年中国共产党成立100年时，实现国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番，全面建成小康社会；到本世纪中叶中华人民共和国成立100年时，建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家，实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦。现在比历史上任何时候都更接近实现我们的奋斗目标，我们有信心、有条件、有能力实现既定的目标。同时，我们也清醒地认识到，中国改革已经进入攻坚期和深水区，经济社会发展进入新的阶段，前进道路上仍然面临不少困难和挑战，还需要付出长期不懈的努力。The world structure is in an important period of evolution while China stands at a critical juncture of national renewal. China's future and destiny are closely connected with those of the world. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the General Secretary, China has made strategic arrangements for its future development and set out the two centenary goals, namely, to double 2010 GDP and per capita income for urban and rural residents and complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects when the CPC celebrates its centenary in 2020, and turn China into a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious and realize the Chinese dream of the great renewal of the Chinese nation when the People's Republic of China marks its centennial in the middle of this century. Never before have we been this close to fulfilling our goals. We are confident and well positioned to achieve the set goals. At the same time, we are also soberly aware that China's reform has reached the crucial stage and waded into the deep water zone. In this new phase of economic and social development, we still have many difficulties and challenges to overcome and will have to make unremitting efforts for many years to come.</p>\n<p>\n\t国际国内形势的发展变化，对中国外交提出了新的更高要求，中国外交正站在新的历史起点上。一年来，习近平主席等中国领导人成功开展一系列重大外交行动，实现外交良好开局，对外发出了中国外交继往开来、勇于担当的明确信息。中国将坚定不移走和平发展道路，坚定不移奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，努力开创同各国合作共赢的新局面。Developments and changes at home and abroad have put forward new, higher requirements for China's diplomacy which now stands at a new historical starting point. Over the past year, President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders have made a good beginning on the diplomatic front through a series of successful major diplomatic initiatives. They have sent out a clear message that China, as a nation committed to fulfilling its responsibility, is building on past achievements and opening up new prospects in its diplomatic work. China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, firmly uphold the independent foreign policy of peace, and strive for new progress in win-win cooperation with other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t我们将统筹自身利益与各国共同利益，同世界各国建设更为紧密的利益共同体。我们将把本国人民的利益同世界各国人民的共同利益结合起来，在实现本国利益的同时，充分照顾他国正当关切和合法权益，绝不做损人利己、以邻为壑的事情。积极扩大同各方利益的汇合点，同各国各地区建立并发展不同领域不同层次的利益共同体，推动实现人类共同利益，共享人类文明进步成果。政治上，尊重各国自主选择的社会制度和发展道路，在平等基础上加强对话交流，深化战略互信。经济上，实行更加积极主动的开放战略，更好地&ldquo;引进来&rdquo;、&ldquo;走出去&rdquo;，把共同利益的蛋糕做大。安全上，倡导全面安全、共同安全、合作安全理念，推动建立平等透明、开放包容的地区和国际安全合作架构。文化上，引导不同文明取长补短、包容互鉴，为人类文明大发展、大繁荣注入新活力。We will integrate our interests with the common interests of other countries and forge a more closely connected community of shared interests. We will combine Chinese people's interests with the common interests of people of other countries, fully accommodate legitimate concerns and lawful rights and interests of other countries while upholding our own interests, and never pursue our own interests at the expense of those of others. We will actively expand converging interests with others, establish and develop communities of common interests with various countries and regions in different areas and at different levels, pursue common interests of the humanity, and share the fruits of progress in human civilization. In the political field, it is important to respect all countries' independent choices of social system and development path, enhance dialogue and exchanges on the basis of equality, and deepen strategic mutual trust. In the economic field, we will be more active in carrying out the opening-up strategy, strive for better results in &quot;bringing in&quot; and &quot;going global&quot; activities, and make the cake of common interests bigger. In the security field, it is necessary to champion the concept of comprehensive, common and cooperative security and promote the building of regional and international security cooperation architecture featuring equality, transparency, openness and inclusiveness. In the cultural field, there is a need to encourage different civilizations to draw on each other's strengths in the spirit of inclusiveness and inject fresh vitality to great development and prosperity of human civilization.</p>\n<p>\n\t我们将统筹与大国、周边及发展中国家关系，谱写与各国友好合作的新篇章。大国关系攸关世界和平和人类福祉。中方愿与各大国一道，推动相互关系长期稳定健康发展。今年6月，习近平主席与美国总统奥巴马在加州安纳伯格庄园举行会晤，就构建中美新型大国关系达成重要共识，为两国关系发展指明了方向。中美新型大国关系，核心就是不冲突不对抗、相互尊重、合作共赢。中方愿与美方相向而行，不断充实中美新型大国关系的内涵，造福中美两国人民和世界各国人民。我们将大力提升与俄罗斯的全面战略协作伙伴关系水平，全面深化两国各领域务实合作，维护国际战略稳定。进一步挖掘和释放中欧合作潜力，拓展双方利益契合点与合作增长点，推动中欧全面战略伙伴关系实现新发展。积极发展与发展中大国及地区大国的友好合作关系，共同推动构建更加公正、合理的国际新秩序。We will take into overall consideration the growth of relations with major countries, neighbors and developing countries and write a new chapter of friendship and cooperation with other countries. Major-country relations bear on world peace and wellbeing of the mankind. China will work with other major countries to ensure that its relations with them will enjoy long-term, steady and sound growth. Last June, President Xi Jinping and US President Obama met in the Annenberg Estate, California and reached important agreement on the building of a new model of major-country relationship between China and the United States, thus charting the course for the development of bilateral relations. The centerpiece of the new model is non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. China will work with the United States to constantly enrich the content of the new model to the benefit of people in the two countries and the world. We will vigorously upgrade the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination with Russia, deepen practical cooperation in various fields, and maintain international strategic stability. We will further tap cooperation potential with the EU, expand shared interests and growth areas of cooperation, and make fresh progress in China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership. We will actively develop friendly relations and cooperation with major developing countries and major regional countries and jointly work for a new international order that is more just and equitable.</p>\n<p>\n\t邻居好，无价宝。中国越发展，就越体会到和平稳定的周边环境之可贵。我们始终把周边作为外交优先方向。前些天，我们专门召开周边外交工作座谈会，习近平总书记在会上发表重要讲话，强调要坚持与邻为善、以邻为伴，坚持睦邻、安邻、富邻，突出体现亲、诚、惠、容的理念，积极营造更加和平稳定、发展繁荣的周边环境，推动我国发展更多惠及周边国家，实现共同发展。习总书记重要讲话是我国外交理论和实践创新的重要体现，不仅对于我国周边外交，而且对我国全部外交工作都具有深远指导意义。A good neighbor is an invaluable asset. The more China develops, the more it appreciates the value of a peaceful and stable neighborhood. China's neighborhood area has always been a priority on its diplomatic agenda. As a matter of fact, we just had a conference on China's neighborhood diplomacy a few days ago, during which General Secretary Xi Jinping made important remarks. He underlined China's commitment to forging friendship and partnership with its neighbors and fostering an amicable, secure and prosperous neighborhood. He also highlighted the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness that guides China's efforts to build a neighborhood of greater peace, stability, development and prosperity and China's desire to bring more benefits to its neighbors and contribute to common development through its own development. These remarks made by General Secretary Xi are an important manifestation of China's innovation in diplomatic theory and practice. They have far-reaching importance in guiding not only China's neighborhood diplomacy but also its overall diplomacy.</p>\n<p>\n\t发展中国家是中国外交的基石。中国同广大发展中国家命运相连、诉求相近、理念相通，我们始终不会忘记作为发展中国家这个&ldquo;本&rdquo;，将永远做发展中国家的可靠朋友和真诚伙伴。正确处理&ldquo;义&rdquo;和&ldquo;利&rdquo;的关系是中华民族传承至今的道德准则。在与发展中国家的交往合作中，我们将坚持道义为先、义利并举，向发展中国家提供力所能及的帮助，真心实意帮助发展中国家加快发展。Developing countries are the foundation of the conduct of China's diplomacy. China shares a common destiny as well as the same aspiration and vision with other developing countries. China will never forget its identity as a developing country and will always remain a reliable friend and true partner of other developing countries. A balanced approach to justice and interests is a part of the traditional code of ethics of the Chinese nation that we still observe today. In our engagement and cooperation with other developing countries, we will place justice above everything else and pursue our interests on that basis. We will do what we can to help other developing countries and give them sincere assistance to help them achieve faster development.</p>\n<p>\n\t我们将统筹能力、义务与责任，在力所能及的范围内努力为世界的和平与发展事业多作贡献。以更加积极的姿态参与国际事务、发挥负责任大国作用，是新形势下中国外交与时俱进的重要方面。我们将旗帜鲜明地维护国际公平正义，反对任何形式的霸权主义和强权政治，推进国际关系民主化。为解决国际和地区热点问题发挥建设性作用，推动建立更加平等均衡的全球发展伙伴关系，积极参与应对全球性挑战的国际合作，为改革和完善国际治理体系贡献更多中国力量、中国智慧。同时也应看到，中国仍是世界上最大的发展中国家。我们将根据自身发展阶段和实际条件，量力而行、尽力而为，为推动人类进步发挥更大作用。We will, in light of our ability, obligation and responsibility, make more contribution to world peace and development. To get more actively engaged in international affairs and play the role of a major responsible country is an important dimension of China's diplomacy in keeping with the changing times. We will unequivocally uphold international fairness and justice, oppose hegemony and power politics in all forms, and promote democracy in international relations. We will play a constructive part in seeking solutions to international and regional hotspot issues, work to build a more equitable and balanced global partnership for development, actively participate in international cooperation to meet global challenges, and contribute more of China's strength and vision to the reform and improvement of the international governance regime. On the other hand, we should see that China is still the largest developing country in the world. We will act as permitted by China's current stage of development and actual conditions and strive to play a greater role in promoting human progress.</p>\n<p>\n\t我们将统筹自身奋斗目标与各国人民的共同追求，共同创造人类更加美好的未来。中国梦是中国人民的奋斗目标，也事关世界和平与发展。中国梦是和平梦、发展梦、共赢梦。这一梦想的实现既要靠中国人民自身努力奋斗，也离不开国际社会的理解、支持与合作。我们将在实现中国梦的历史进程中，不断拓宽同各国合作的广度和深度，为各国人民过上更加美好的生活创造更多机遇、开辟更大空间，使中国梦既造福中国，也造福世界。We will pursue our own goal as part of the common pursuit of people around the world for a brighter future of mankind. The Chinese dream is not only a goal that the Chinese people are working hard to achieve; it is also important for peace and development of the world. The Chinese dream is a dream about peace, development and win-win progress. To realize this dream requires both the hard work of the Chinese people and the understanding, support and cooperation of the international community. In this historic process of realizing the Chinese dream, we will steadily deepen and expand cooperation with other countries to create more opportunities and bigger space for people of other countries to pursue a better life. Thus the Chinese dream will benefit not only China but also the world at large.</p>\n<p>\n\t女士们，先生们：Ladies and Gentlemen</p>\n<p>\n\t百闻不如一见。希望在座各位今后有机会多来中国参观、访问、交流，继续关注中国的进步、支持中国的发展。相信通过我们之间频繁的接触交流，大家不仅能够&ldquo;读懂&rdquo;中国，而且也会把一个客观真实的中国介绍给世界，为促进中国与世界的相互了解、增进中国人民与各国人民的友好合作发挥积极作用，作出更大贡献。Seeing once is better than hearing one hundred times from others. I hope you will come to China more for visits and exchanges and continue to follow China's progress and support its development. I believe that our close contact and exchanges will enable you to better appreciate China and present a true China to the world in an objective way. In doing so, you can play an active role and make greater contribution to enhancing mutual understanding between China and the world and the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese people and the people of other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t谢谢大家！Thank you.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; color: #999999;\">\n\t声明：沪江网高度重视知识产权保护，发现本网站发布的信息包含有侵犯其著作权的链接内容时，请联系我们，我们将做相应处理。</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p547683/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p547683\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p547912/\">哥伦比亚大学最近很红！走进哥大</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p547507/\">2013年最实用的10个大学专业</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p546417/\">今日免费公开课：把听力装进口语</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p103560/\">沪江英语资料下载帮助及沪元知识</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p547654/\">爱之旅行：盘点全球十大浪漫之城</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p547887/\">感人视频：顽强小宝宝成长的一年</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p433645/\">感恩口语：thank, appreciate和grateful的不同用法</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p547686/\">沪江英乐合辑：感恩节正能量季</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p547693/\">Kid President：9岁小孩总统励志演讲</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p547254/\">大学里你学不到的7个人生技能</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
