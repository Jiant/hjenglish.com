Most of these plants and animals are too small for the human eye to see. They drift about lazily with the currents, providing a basic food for many larger animals. Plankton has been described as the equivalent of the grasses that grow on the dry land continents, and the comparison is an appropriate one. In potential food value however, <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/plankton\" target=\"_blank\">plankton</a> far outweighs that of the land grasses. One scientist has estimated that while grasses of the world produce about 49 billion tons of valuable carbohydrates each year. The sea&rsquo;s plankton generates more than twice as much.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite its enormous food potential, little effort was made until recently to farm plankton as we farm grasses on land. Now marine scientists have at last begun to study this possibility, especially as the sea&rsquo;s resources loom even more important as a means of feeding an expanding world population.</p>\n<p>\n\tNo one yet has seriously suggested that &ldquo;planktonburgers&rdquo; may soon become popular around the world. As a possible farmed supplementary food source, however, plankton is gaining considerable interest among marine scientists.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne type of plankton that seems to have great harvest possibilities is a tiny shrimplike creature called <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/krill\" target=\"_blank\">krill</a>. Growing to two or three inches long, krill provide the major food for the giant blue whale, the largest animal ever to inhabit the Earth. Realizing that this whale may grow 100 feet and weigh 150 tons at maturity, it is not surprising that each one devours more than one ton of krill daily.</p>\n<p>\n\tKrill swim about just below the surface in huge schools sometimes miles wide, mainly in the cold Antarctic. Because of their pink color, they often appear as a solid reddish mass when viewed from a ship or from the air. Krill are very high in food value. A pound of these crustaceans contains about 460 calories&mdash;about the same as shrimp or lobster, to which they are related.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf the krill can feed such huge creatures as whales, many scientists reason, they must certainly be contenders as new food source for humans.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>1. Which of the following best portrays the organization of the passage?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tA. The author presents the advantages and disadvantages of plankton as a food source.</p>\n<p>\n\tB. The author quotes public opinion to support the argument for farming plankton.</p>\n<p>\n\tC. The author classifies the different food sources according to amount of carbohydrate.</p>\n<p>\n\tD. The author makes a general statement about plankton as a food source and then moves to a specific example.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2. According to the passage, why is plankton regarded to be more valuable than land grasses?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tA. It is easier to cultivate.</p>\n<p>\n\tB. It produces more carbohydrates.</p>\n<p>\n\tC. It does not require soil.</p>\n<p>\n\tD. It is more palatable.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3. Why does the author mention &ldquo;planktonburgers&rdquo;?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tA. To describe the appearance of one type of plankton.</p>\n<p>\n\tB. To illustrate how much plankton a whale consumes.</p>\n<p>\n\tC. To suggest plankton as a possible food sources.</p>\n<p>\n\tD. To compare the food values of beef and plankton.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>4. What is mentioned as one conspicuous feature of krill?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tA. They are the smallest marine animals.</p>\n<p>\n\tB. They are pink in color.</p>\n<p>\n\tC. They are similar in size to lobsters.</p>\n<p>\n\tD. They have grass like bodies.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>5. The author mentions all of the following as reasons why plankton could be considered a human food source except that it is ___.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tA. high in food value.</p>\n<p>\n\tB. in abundant supply in the oceans.</p>\n<p>\n\tC. an appropriate food for other animals.</p>\n<p>\n\tD. free of chemicals and pollutants.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>参考答案：</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tDBCBD</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.8em;\">声明：沪江网高度重视知识产权保护，发现本网站发布的信息包含有侵犯其著作权的链接内容时，请联系我们，我们将做相应处理。</span></p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p539451/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p539451\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p544642/\">6大细节证明 你其实没那么聪明</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p544415/\">考前一个月英语四级六级新题型复习资料汇总</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p103560/\">沪江英语资料下载帮助及沪元知识</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p544312/\">BBC看中国：“土豪”成英语热词</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p544936/\">受够家庭琐事 全球首例机器人自杀？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p544970/\">愤怒女士辣酱！老干妈征服美国小伙伴</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p545044/\">萌组合：男童扮虎仔 与幼虎隔窗嬉戏</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p545124/\">泰勒&bull;斯威夫特亮相维密秀 激情献唱</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p105803/\">【教程】手把手教你下载沪江英语资料</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p544431/\">不会搭配？6套不会穿错的经典搭配</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
