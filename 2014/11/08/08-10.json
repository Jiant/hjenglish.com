Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</b></p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I want to make a complaint about a defective product or poor service, I would rather make my complaint in writing. Writing a complaint allows me to organize my points of argument in a logical manner. If I&rsquo;m really unhappy with the way I&rsquo;m being treated, I want to present my reasons clearly. I don&rsquo;t want there to be any confusion about why I&rsquo;m complaining. I like to list my complaints and then list supporting examples. That&rsquo;s the best way of making sure everyone is clear about what I;m saying.</p>\n<p>\n\tPutting my complaint in writing also ensures it won&rsquo;t seem too emotional. If you feel that you&rsquo;re been treated badly or taken advantage of, it&rsquo;s easy to lash out. Losing your temper, though, is a sure ways to lose your argument. Yelling is very satisfying at the moment, but it only makes the person you&rsquo;re yelling at mad at you. It doesn&rsquo;t get them to agree with you or to offer help.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere&rsquo;s also the issue of the person you&rsquo;re dealing with. If you complaint in person, you have to talk to whoever is there. Chances are that he or she isn&rsquo;t the person responsible for the defective product or the poor service. Often the people who take complaints are not the people in change, unless you&rsquo;re dealing with a very small business. Yelling at them isn&rsquo;t fair, and doesn&rsquo;t do anything to get a refund or satisfaction for you. You need to reach the person in charge. The best way to do that is in writing.</p>\n<p>\n\tWriting about your complaint and sending the letter registered mail also gives you written proof. It&rsquo;s clear that you tried to settle the matter in a reasonable manner within a certain time period. This way, if you need to take further action, you have physical evidence of your actions.</p>\n<p>\n\tWriting a complaint has the advantages of organization, effectiveness, and fairness. That&rsquo;s why I prefer to write rather than personally present my complaints.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>130 EX People remember special gifts or presents that they have received. Why? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</b></p>\n<p>\n\tI think we remember special gifts we&rsquo;ve received because these gifts often are part of a special memory for us. It may be a memory of someone special we&rsquo;ve cared deeply about. He or she may no longer be alive. Or it may be a memory of a special event in our lives. It may even be a memory of the person we once were at some particular moment in our lives.</p>\n<p>\n\tGifts from other people can make us feel joy every time we look at them. A gift from our parents, or our husband or wife makes us feel loved each time we see or use it. If we have children, the first gift our child made for us in kindergarten is cherished long after the child has grown up. A family heirloom given to us by a grandparent makes us feel connected to our past. A gift from a good friend is a reminder of all the good times we&rsquo;ve shared. A memento from a respected colleague of a reminder of a job we worked on successfully together.</p>\n<p>\n\tGift may also pinpoint special events in our lives. Gifts given to us as part of our religious heritage, such as First Communion or Chanukkah gifts, remind us of those celebrations. The same is true for gifts given for birthdays and graduations, and for the anniversaries of special days in our lives, like our wedding day.</p>\n<p>\n\tGifts can also be a symbol of the person we were at a particular point in our lives. A gift received in childhood may remind us of a passionate hobby that&rsquo;s now boxed in the attic. A gift received when we left a job may bring to mind the first career we bad, now that we&rsquo;re on our third or fourth.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe gifts that are important to us are the ones that remind us of family, friends and happy times. They&rsquo;re a way of surrounding ourselves with our past.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" id=\"editorA4style2\" style=\"border: 1px dotted rgb(255, 165, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(255, 140, 0);\">考好托福 去美国留学啦！</span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/7446/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/201002/201002051430571921.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/7131/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/201003/201003025243096352.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/6575/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/200909/200909243171546915.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/5218/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/200905/200905132304915319.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://chat.53kf.com/company.php?arg=hjbook&amp;style=1\" title=\"\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/2009/images/btn_kechengzixun.gif\" /></a></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p703739/page2/\">点击查看第二页</a><br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p703739/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p703739\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p705102/\">14个看似不靠谱却有效的减肥妙招</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p704691/\">1岁半\"小碧昂斯\"：美丽要从婴儿培养</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p103560/\">沪江英语资料下载帮助及沪元知识</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p705058/\">立冬啦 关于冬天不可不知的3个单词</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p705174/\">卷福订婚：网友吐槽“花生怎么办”</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p705306/\">袁老师帮你背单词之冬天来了</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p703693/\">如何找到“达西先生” 简&bull;奥斯丁的恋爱指南</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p705180/\">傲慢与偏见 10大改名换姓的经典名著</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p580791/\">一位爸爸写给女儿的信：关于你未来的那个他</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p704837/\">天冷难起床？十大奇葩旷工理由</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
