Use specific reasons to develop your essay.</b></p>\n<p>\n\tMost of us can learn how to do something simple on our own with just a set of instructions. However, to learn about something more complex, it's always best to have a teacher.<br />\n\tTeachers bring with them varied and useful backgrounds. They've been trained to teach individuals in different ways depending on their style. For instance, omen students learn better by discussing a topic. Others learn more by writing about it. Teachers can help students learn in the way that's best of each student. A textbook or a manual can only give you one way of learning something. Plus they're only as helpful as your ability to understand them. A good teacher can adapt her teaching to your needs.<br />\n\tTeachers help you focus on what you're learning. If you're learning something by yourself, it&rsquo;s easy to become distracted, and go on to other activities. Teachers keep your attention on the subject. They also approach a subject logically, taking it one step at a time. On your own, it's tempting to skip parts of the learning process you think you don&rsquo;t need. That can binder your ability to really understand the subject.<br />\n\tLearning a subject on your own is a very narrow way of learning. You can only use the information you get from the textbook. With a teacher, you get the information in the written materials as well as the teacher's own knowledge of the topic. Teachers can also provide extra materials to broaden the scope of what you're learning.<br />\n\tThere's nothing wrong with studying on your own, and a learner can always benefit from some quiet study. For the best possible learning, though, a&nbsp; good teacher is the biggest help you can have.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>18 What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.</b></p>\n<p>\n\tEven though job situations can&nbsp; be very different, there are several qualities that all good supervisor have in common, A good boss treats all her employees fairly. She doesn't single out one employee for better(or worse)treatment than the others. A poor supervisor has favorites. Sometimes she'll even use her favorites to spy on&nbsp; other employees. She expects them to tell her what the others are saying about her. This can cause a lot of bad feeling among employees.<br />\n\tA good supervisor gives clear and understandable directions. She doesn't constantly change her mind about what she wants employees to do. She also doesn't get angry with an employee who is confused and needs her to explain the directions again or more fully. Delegating authority well is another quality of a good supervisor. She knows how to use the skills of her employees to best advantage. A poor supervisor insists on doing everything herself. She is unwilling to give any authority to others.<br />\n\tA good boss evaluates her employees on a reasonable ser of criteria, not on how she feels about them personally. And she lets the employees know what those criteria are, so they have a fair chance of meeting them.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe gives both praise and criticism in a straightforward manner. She also offers guidance when needed. A poor supervisor will criticize without giving any suggestions on how to improve.<br />\n\tMost importantly, a good supervisor set the standards for her employee by her own behavior. She works hard and treats employees like valuable assets to the company. This promotes good morale among her workers, and this is of great benefit to her business.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" id=\"editorA4style2\" style=\"border: 1px dotted rgb(255, 165, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t\t\t\t<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(255, 140, 0);\">考好托福 去美国留学啦！</span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/7446/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/201002/201002051430571921.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/7131/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/201003/201003025243096352.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/6575/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/200909/200909243171546915.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.hjbook.net/lesson/5218/?source=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i1.w.hjfile.cn/shop/200905/200905132304915319.jpg\" /></a></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://chat.53kf.com/company.php?arg=hjbook&amp;style=1\" title=\"\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/2009/images/btn_kechengzixun.gif\" /></a></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p702755/page2/\">点击查看第二页</a><br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p702755/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p702755\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p703035/\">这些面相你有吗 美国人也以貌取人</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p103560/\">沪江英语资料下载帮助及沪元知识</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p703473/\">你也是这样？城市化程度影响我们性选择偏好</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p703240/\">科学家最新研究 人类寿命上限120岁</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p702890/\">喵星人告诉你 什么才叫躲猫猫</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p702719/\">英国神童6岁办画展 年收入百万镑</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p702427/\">梦想之路（有声）</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p703026/\">西班牙士兵当选宇宙最帅先生</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p703563/\">情圣骗子超越版 5老婆7未婚妻5女友</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p161331/\">新概念英语第一册Lesson 1  Excuse me</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
