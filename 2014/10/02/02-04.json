  "description": "<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\"><b>Which test is more difficult?</b> </span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">For most people this question is irrelevant, as most people know many Universities or colleges will specify which test you must take. Most institutions will accept one but not the other, although the number of schools which accept both seems to be increasing gradually.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">If you are one of the people faced with the choice, there are a few differences which you might consider before making your decision.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">Overall the two tests are actually quite similar. They both involve a long and exhausting test session. For many people these two tests will be the longest &quot;exam sitting&quot; they have experienced.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">Obviously both tests now include the same 4 modules (Speaking, Writing, Listening and Reading) although these are broken down into sub-tests quite differently, <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL</a> preferring a larger number of smaller test modules (e.g. 6 <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">separate speaking sub-tests</a>).</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">Another clear similarity is that for both the speaking and writing tests these two testing systems use very detailed and precise marking systems. This is where the real differences exist, in the actual way that the scores are given.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\"><b>The Speaking Test</b></span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">When you analyze the marking criteria for the two tests it starts to become clear that these tests are quite different.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">If you consider the scoring system overall, the key difference is the band scores. <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL Speaking</a> awards scores on a scale of 1 to 4 whereas as <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS</a> uses 1 to 9.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">The important thing to realize here is that the differences between the scores or the &quot;score boundaries&quot; will be quite different. Because <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL</a> only awards scores from 1 to 4, candidates in the score region of 3 for example can actually have quite different levels of ability. In contrast, for <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS </a>candidates, people in the band level of 6 will have very similar overall Speaking abilities.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">How do the scores relate to each other? A commonly asked question is whether a<a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\"> TOEFL Speaking </a>Level 4 is the same as an <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS Speaking</a> Band 9. The answer is that the scores are not parallel. It is not easy to calculate but an intelligent estimation would be that a TOEFL Level 4 is approximately the same level as an IELTS 6.5.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">However, as I explained the TOEFL score is wider, so in fact any IELTS Speaking candidate with a score of 6 - 9 would most likely be awarded Level 4 in TOEFL.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">What does this mean for the candidate? One way that this could be relevant is for very high level candidates. A candidate with excellent Spoken English would really be given the recognition that he or she deserves, for example a Band Score 8 or 9. If that same candidate took the <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL test</a> they would only be able to score Level 4 in each question, putting them in the same category as some one who is only an <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS Band</a> 6.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">I witnessed this situation recently. A student from one of my TOEFL classes scored very high in the <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL Speaking Test </a>and then two months later took the <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS test</a> and scored 6.0 for Speaking.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">From this point of view it can be said that it is easier to achieve high scores in <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL Speaking</a> than it is in <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS Speaking.</a></span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\"><b>What are differences in the marking systems?</b></span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">One thing that we must remember is that both systems are testing your ability to use spoken English in an academic context. This means that on a fundamental level they are both testing the basic elements of speaking: vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, fluency, error frequency, consistent mistakes and expression.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">However, one distinction in the marking systems is that the focus is not the same. If we take a very simple view, it could be said that <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL Speaking</a> works in this way; if you take a non-native English Speaker and put them into an English Speaking Academic Environment (e.g. a university lecture on economics) how well would the candidate be able to interact with other students and the lecturer.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">The <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL Speaking</a> test is much more focused on your ability to use English in relation to academic tasks and to express your ideas clearly.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">So really<a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\"> TOEFL Speaking</a> takes the approach that candidates do not need to be &quot;expert users&quot; of English, they just need to be competent in using English to participate in academic discussion.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\"><a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS</a> does not follow the same pattern. The scores for <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS Speaking</a> focus much more on colloquial language ability. IELTS does not put your speaking ability into the &quot;classroom context&quot;.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">The higher scores for IELTS are testing your ability to produce certain features of spoken English that are typical of native-speakers.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">This means that <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS Speaking</a> is actually less academically focused that TOEFL. To achieve a high IELTS score candidates must demonstrate the ability to use &quot;native-speaker style language&quot;, this includes things like slang, uncommon vocabulary and conversational devices (spoken linking words).</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">To summarize this we can say that<a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\"> IELTS</a> is about speaking English in a natural native-speaker style and <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL</a> is about using English in relation to academic tasks.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\"><b>Are the tasks similar?</b></span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\"><a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL Speaking</a> Questions 1 and 2 are very similar to <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS Speaking</a> questions. Many of the topics used are identical and it is difficult to say who is copying who, many of the newer topics in both IELTS and TOEFL are exactly the same.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">Questions 3-6 in <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL</a> are Task-based so they require the candidate to have some ability to read and listen. This is another difference, a student with terrible listening and reading skills would still be able to achieve a high score in<a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\"> IELTS speaking</a> but this student would have problems with TOEFL questions 3-6.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\"><b>Will my accent make a difference?</b></span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">This is one of the most common pronunciation questions. Quite simply the answer is that accent is not actually marked in either test.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">Of course if you have a British, American or Australian accent your pronunciation will be much clearer and easier to understand (regardless of where your examiner comes from). Some students believe that they will lose marks if they use an American accent or in IELTS or a British accent in TOEFL, this is not true.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">If we return to the marking system, in <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS </a>the highest pronunciation score is Band 8 - to achieve this score you need to produce some kind of accent &quot;similar to native speaker&quot; (but any kind of native speaker is acceptable). <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL Speaking</a> Level 4 does not require an accent - you just need to be &quot;understandable&quot;. So again it is clear that if you have a beautiful British or American accent you will be given more credit for this in<a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\"> IELTS</a> than in <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/toefl/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">TOEFL</a>.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\">To summarize all of this we can conclude that if you really believe that you have excellent spoken English you will be rewarded more in terms of scores with <a href=\"http://liuxue.hujiang.com/ielts/speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">IELTS</a>.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"dipbbs_content\"><br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p700154/page2/\">点击查看第二页</a><br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p700154/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p700154\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p594918/\">99%的人连Where are you from都不会回答！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p655689/\">2014年秋季档10月热门美剧一览</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p103560/\">沪江英语资料下载帮助及沪元知识</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p699770/\">保加利亚最古老大学授予莫言最高荣誉</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p699946/\">笑死朕 史上3位笑死的名人</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p700050/\">iPhone 6入华 10月10日起接受预订</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p700010/\">想要牙齿好 有机果汁要少喝</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p532552/\">免费在线学：CCTalk英语大厅课程表</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p161331/\">新概念英语第一册Lesson 1  Excuse me</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p530074/\">12个Excel基础技巧 菜鸟变达人</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
