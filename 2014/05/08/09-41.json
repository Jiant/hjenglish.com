Somepeoplebelieve that breaking a mirroris a (S1)<u>terrible</u>thing to do. They say itwill bring you seven years of (S2)<u>misfortune.</u>The reason behindthis belief stems the old idea that a person&rsquo;ssoul isin their(S3)<u>reflection,</u>so that if you smash your mirror, you soul willbe (S4)<u>damaged </u>too, dooming you do an earlydeath, and not giving you entry to(S5)<u>heaven</u>. Is there any way to reversethis bad luck? Yes&mdash;if you very carefully(S6)<u>pick </u>&nbsp;up all the broken pieces of the mirror and throw them into a river or stream, then&nbsp; the bad luck will be&rdquo;(S7) <u>washed</u>away&rdquo;..</p>\n<p>\n\tOf all number, 13 is the most associated with bad luck. (S8) <u>Some </u><u>people</u><u>claim that the number is bad luck because thirteen people sat down for the Last Supper before Jesus was crucified</u>, and with this in mind few hosts will serve dinner with thirteen at the table. And according to an ancient Norwegian tale, twelve gods had gathered for a feast when a thirteenth, Loke, entered. After the meal, Loke killed Balder, who wasthe most beloved of all the gods.</p>\n<p>\n\t(S9) Fridaythe thirteenth of any month is considered especially bad or unlucky, and Fridaythe thirteenthof March is theworstof the all.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe number seven also has some superstitionconnectedto it. It is said that God created the worldin seven days, and any association with the number is luck. The seventh son of theseventhsonis said tobe the luckiestof men, and(S10)<u>When </u><u>people</u><u>talk about the </u><u>&ldquo;</u><u>seven-year itch</u><u>&rdquo;</u><u>they mean that every </u><u>seven</u><u>years a </u><u>person</u><u>undergoes a complete change in personality.</u></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Task3: The Status on Easter Island</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Script</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the greatestmysterieson Earth is the statueson Easter Island. The island is one of the mostremote placeson Earth, locatedin the southern PacificOcean. It was almost uninhabited when it was discoveredon Easter Day in 1722 by a Dutchcaptain, but it is covered with hundredsof giant statues, each weighing several tons and some standing more than 30 feet tall.</p>\n<p>\n\tWho carved thesestatures, and how and why were theyput there?</p>\n<p>\n\tNobody knows the answerfor sure, but many ate trying to find out. Thereare many theoriesto explainthis mystery. It has even been suggested thespace aliens may have playeda role regarding thesegiant statues. Another theory relates to the fact that EasterIsland was inhabited by Polynesian seafarers, whotraveled thousand ofmiles in their canoes, guided by the stars, the color of sky and the sun , the shapes of clouds, andthe presence of birds making flights out to sea seekingfood. The Polynesians first arrivedon the island in 499A.D.However, the ocean currents which carriedthem there would mot takethem back. They weretrapped and, having arrivedthere, could not leave. The Polynesiansprobablecared the statues themselves, perhaps as religioussymbols.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo date, 887 statues have been discoveredon the island. However, only a few statues were carried intended destination. The rest were abandoned along the way.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe statues appear to have been carved out of the top edgeof walls of a volcano on theisland. After a statue was carved, it may have been rolled or dragged down to the base of the volcano. Then it wasput upright, and ropes were tied around it. Using a pulley system, the statue was moves to its intended destination.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt its peak, the population of Eater Island is believed to have reached11,000. Eventually, the resourcesof the islandwere exhausted, and the people resorted to cannibalism, eating one another. Work on the statues stopped andthe statues were knocked over. When the firstEuropeans finallyarrivedon theisland, most of the people lad died out.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 18.0pt;\">\n\t23.

Speaking Out</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODEL 1</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>This is a custom that dates back to the ancient Celts.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>Sue, do you know why people say, &ldquo;knock on wood&rdquo;when they want to avoid bad luck?</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Susan:</strong>It sounds a bit funny. As far as I know,<u>it has a lot to do</u>withancient Celtic people. They worshipped trees.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 70.85pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>Sounds interesting.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 70.85pt;\">\n\t<strong>Susan:</strong>They thoughts trees would suck demonsback intothe ground.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris:</strong>Well, when you think about the deep roots,<u>their belief seems to make some senses.</u></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 41.3pt;\">\n\t<strong>Susan:</strong>What&rsquo;s more, <u>knocking on</u><u>wood was a way to brag without being punished</u>. People oncethought that evil spirits would become jealous if good fortunewas pointedout to them</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris:</strong>Uh, yes, go on.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 41.3pt;\">\n\t<strong>Susan</strong>:well, by knocking on wood three times,the noise could frightened away the evil spirits, and they couldn&rsquo;t have to rob the braggartof that good fortune</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.2pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris:</strong>I&rsquo;m afraidthosewho don&rsquo;t know this superstition <u>might be frightened away</u>as well.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 76.75pt;\">\n\t<strong>Susan:</strong>Now here&rsquo;s a test. Do you know <u>how the custom of kissing under the mistletoe </u><u>originated</u>?</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 76.75pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris:</strong><u>I haven</u><u>&rsquo;</u><u>t the slightest idea</u>, but I&rsquo;m all ears.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 76.5pt;\">\n\t<strong>Susan:</strong>Again <u>this</u><u>is a custom that dates back to the ancient Celts</u>. Since they worshipped trees, they conducted many of theirceremonies in the woods in the shade of trees.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong><u>Now I see</u>. Probably it&rsquo;s under these mistletoe trees that weddings took place.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Susan:</strong>I wish you were standing under some mistletoe right now.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>Luckily I&rsquo;m not. Touch wood.</p>\n<p>\n\tMODEL2 Is<strong>there any relationship </strong><strong>between</strong><strong>superstitions and real life?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Script</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 41.3pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>It&rsquo;s strange that <u>so many </u><u>people</u><u>are </u><u>superstitious</u>. There must be some relationship betweensuperstitionsand real life.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 41.3pt;\">\n\t<strong>Susan</strong><strong>:</strong>You know, Richard Wiseman, a British psychologistresearched the relationshipbetweensuperstitionand luck.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>What did he find? Most people would be interested. At leastI would</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Susan</strong><strong>:</strong><u>He polled ,000 people</u>and fond that people who believe themselvesto be lucky tend to go for positive superstitions.They may wear a ring asa talisman or often say,&rdquo; touchwood&rdquo;for good luck.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>Then, <u>what </u><u>about</u><u>the unlucky</u><u>people</u>? Do you meanif they think they ate unlucky, they tendto believe in superstitionsabut bad luck.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Susan</strong><strong>:</strong>Yeah. <u>They worry a lot about a broken </u><u>mirror</u><u>,</u>a black cat runningacross theirpath, andso on.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Chris:&nbsp; </strong><u>So what is his point?</u></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Susan</strong><strong>:</strong>His point is that peoplemake theirown luck by theirattitudeto life. So, 49 percentof lucky people regularlycross theirfingers, compared to 30 percentof unlucky people. And only 18 percentof lucky peopleare anxious if they break a mirror.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>So, <u>our fate is linked to our attitude rather </u><u>than to</u><u>our </u><u>superstitions</u><u>.</u></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Susan</strong><strong>:</strong>I think<u>that</u><u>&rsquo;</u><u>s what he is suggesting.</u></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>This research seemstoo complicates. <u>If I were a </u><u>psychologist</u><u>, I would conduct a survey</u>to find whether 13 reallyis an unlucky number. I f there ere trafficaccidents or murders on the 13<sup>th</sup> than on other days, then we have tobelievein superstitions.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Susan</strong><strong>:</strong>What if there weren&rsquo;t?</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 41.3pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>Then <u>I wouldn</u><u>&rsquo;</u><u>t be </u><u>superstitious</u><u>.</u></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 41.3pt;\">\n\t<strong>Susan: </strong>What a brilliant idea! I never expected you to be as wise as Solomon.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 41.3pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>Well as long as you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a fool.</p>\n<p>\n\tMODEL3 &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe ETs have visited the earthbefore.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Script</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 41.3pt;\">\n\t<strong>Nora: </strong>Hey, what&rsquo;s this picture of yours? It lookslike a flying saucer.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 41.3pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>It is. <u>I was visited by aliens</u>last week and this is a pictureof theirspacecraft.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 41.3pt;\">\n\t<strong>Nora</strong><strong>:</strong>When I look closer, it resembles a liver Frisbee.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>But it could have been aliens. <u>I believe</u><u>ETs </u><u>have</u><u>visited the </u><u>earth</u><u>befor</u>e. What do you think?</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Nora</strong><strong>:</strong>It would be hard to believe otherwise. <u>Projects </u><u>like</u><u>the pyramids are difficult </u><u>to</u><u>explain away,</u>given the level of technology that was available at the time</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris:</strong><u>That</u><u>&rsquo;</u><u>s for </u><u>sure</u><u>. They are </u><u>mysterious</u><u>.</u></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Nora</strong><strong>:</strong>When youconsider all those &ldquo;impossibilities, it&rsquo;s tempting to infer that <u>some</u><u>highly</u><u>advance</u><u>d </u><u>civilization</u><u>assisted humans in </u><u>their</u><u>construction</u>.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>Think about this: if youwere abducted by aliens andtakenup to theirspaceshipor something &hellip;well&hellip;</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Nora</strong><strong>:</strong>What do you mean?</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 35.4pt;\">\n\t<strong>Chris: </strong>I mean, who would believe you? <u>You</u><u>&rsquo;</u><u>d go nuts</u>tellingeveryone: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!

When you think about the cross, sign of Christianity, that belief seems to makesomesense.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 53.15pt;\">\n\t<strong>Eliza:</strong>&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true. That&rsquo;s why children often cross their fingers whenthey tell a small lie.

He launched an Internet Survey of national superstition, and found it to be surprisingly high, even among those witha scientific background. Only morein ten of those surveyed claimed not to be superstitiousat all. Three out of four people in Britain feel the need to touch wood, and 65% cross their fingers.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is interesting to note that lucky people were much less superstitious and tended to take constructive actionto improve their lives. Conversely, superstitiouspeople tended to regard themselves as among the less lucky, worried about life, had a strongneed for control, and could not tolerate ambiguity.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe survey also revealed some unexpected beliefs. For example, one respondentcouldnot stay in the bathroom once a toilethad been flushed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was no evidence that superstitiousever worked, even, when peoplewere instructed to carry lucky charms for a week. They didn&rsquo;tfeel any luckieror more stratifiedwith theirlivesat the endof that week than whentheystarted.</p>\n<p>\n\tArmstrong attemptedto explain thisphenomenon: &ldquo;When studentsare preparing for exams with a lucky charm, they may trust the charm, rather than doing some extra revision.&rdquo;</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 139px;\">\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"center\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Reasons foe More Superstitions</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 429px;\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks, perhaps, to <u>falling stock markets</u>&nbsp;andunrest in theMiddle East, Britons have become<u>even more superstitious </u><u>than</u><u>usual</u></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 139px;\">\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"center\">\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"center\">\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"center\">\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"center\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Who are more </strong><strong>superstitious</strong><strong>?</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 429px;\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tLuckypeople were much less superstitious and tended to <u>take constructive </u><u>action</u>to improve their lives.

Most people believe thiscomes from the fact that the horseshoe is shaped like the crescent moon, a period of prosperityand good fortune. One legend has it that theDevil was in disguise and wandering at large, looking for trouble. He happened to call on St. Dunstan, who ea skilled in shoeinghorses. St. Dunstan recognizedthe Devil and tiedhim to a wall with onlyhis feet free to move. He thenset to work shoeing him as though he were a horse, but with such roughness the Devil cried out for mercy. St. Dunstan stopped hiswork and released the Devil after making him promise never to enter a home on which a horseshoe was fixed. Witches fear horses,so they are also turned away by a doorwith a horseshoe mounted on it. The big issue regarding horseshoes is whetherthey should be hung points up or points down.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe original superstitionwas that the horseshoe is points up to keep the luck frompouringout. Despitethis view most buildings with horseshoes in theirsign hang&nbsp; them the oppositeway. TheHorseshoe Casino in Las Vegas hangs its horseshoe with the arc on top. They may be hoping theircustomers&rsquo;luck runs out, but thisis usually not something you advertise in your sign. Finger rings made of horseshoenail are said to keep away badluck.

As a non-native speaker, you might say the figure zero as a plain zero which is absolutely fine, but often an English native speaker will use a number of ways to say zero depending on where they are from. So understanding what they mean is important.学会如何用英文说&ldquo;0&rdquo;对于消除误解是非常重要的，尤其是打电话和视频会议的时候。由于英语不是母语，你可能觉得用&ldquo;zero&rdquo;来说&ldquo;0&rdquo;没什么问题，但是在不同的语境下，母语是英语的人可能会用其他的方式来表达&ldquo;0&rdquo;。所以理解其他的表述方法也很重要。</p>\n<p>\n\t0 is zero and in British English, it&rsquo;s sometimes known as nought.&ldquo;0&rdquo;在英式英语中就是&ldquo;zero&rdquo;，有时候英国人也会用&ldquo;nought&rdquo;表示&ldquo;0&rdquo;。<br />\n\tIn telephone numbers, room numbers, bus numbers and dates (years), we say oh.如果&ldquo;0&rdquo;出现在电话号码，房间号，公车号或是日期（年份）中，我们发&ldquo;oh&rdquo;的音。</p>\n<p>\n\t比如：</p>\n<p>\n\tThe meeting is in Room 502 (five<strong> oh</strong> two)在502开会<br />\n\tYou need to take Bus 205 (two <strong>oh </strong>five)您需要乘坐205号公交<br />\n\tShe was born in 1907 (nineteen <strong>oh </strong>seven)她出生于1907年<br />\n\tMy telephone number is 07781 020 560 (<strong>oh </strong>double seven eight one <strong>oh </strong>two <strong>oh </strong>five six <strong>oh </strong>OR <strong>zero </strong>seven seven eight one <strong>zero </strong>two <strong>zero </strong>five six <strong>zero</strong>)我的电话号码是07781 020 560</p>\n<p>\n\tFor football scores we say nil: &lsquo;The score was <strong>three nil</strong> (3-0) to Barcelona&rsquo;.如果是足球比赛我们会用&ldquo;nil&rdquo;代表零，如：&quot;和巴塞罗那队的比分是3-0（<strong>three nil </strong>）&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tAmerican English uses various words for sports scores: The Yankees are winning<strong> three nothing/ three zero/ three zip</strong>.美式英语有多种方式表达比赛得分中的&ldquo;0&rdquo;，如：洋基队3-0战胜了对手，&ldquo;3-0&rdquo;就可以说成&ldquo;<strong>three nothing/ three zero/ three zip</strong>&rdquo;。</p>\n<p>\n\t如果是网球比分，我们就会用&ldquo;love&rdquo;表示&ldquo;0&rdquo;，比分是30-0就说成&ldquo;The score was<strong> thirty love</strong>. (30-0)&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"http://i2.w.yun.hjfile.cn/doc/201405/2237bbc44cba414d951f01408c4fca92.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>\n\t如果表示温度，我们就用&ldquo;zero&rdquo;，如：今天0度就是&lsquo;It&rsquo;s <strong>zero degrees celsius</strong> today (0&deg;)</p>\n<p>\n\tThe decimal point (Notice that in English we say decimal point, and not a dot as in internet addresses). In British English, zero and nought are used before and after a decimal point. American English does not use nought.小数点（注意英语中用&ldquo;decimal point&rdquo;来表示小数点，而不是网址中的&ldquo;dot&rdquo;）,在英式英语中&ldquo;zero&rdquo;和&ldquo;nought &rdquo;可以用在小数点之前和之后。美式英语则不用&ldquo;nought&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src=\"http://i2.w.yun.hjfile.cn/doc/201405/78b398a10ffc48c3bde53aefee25dedd.gif\" /></p>\n<p>\n\tOh can be used after the decimal point.&ldquo;Oh&rdquo;也可以用在小数点之后</p>\n<p>\n\t比如：</p>\n<p>\n\t0.05就是&ldquo; <strong>zero </strong>point <strong>zero </strong>five&rdquo; 或者&ldquo;<strong>nought </strong>point <strong>nought </strong>five&rdquo;<br />\n\t0.5% 就是&ldquo; <strong>zero </strong>point five percent &rdquo;或者&ldquo; <strong>nought </strong>point five percent&rdquo;<br />\n\t0.501 就是&ldquo;<strong>zero </strong>point five <strong>zero </strong>one&rdquo;或者&ldquo; <strong>nought </strong>point five <strong>nought </strong>one&rdquo;或者&ldquo; <strong>nought</strong>/<strong>zero </strong>point five <strong>oh </strong>one&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #006400;\"><strong>沪江小编：</strong></span>大家晕了吗？不用急，Like everything in this world, practice makes perfect！只要多在工作中使用这些说法，就不会混淆了。下面小编给出几个例子，大家练习一下吧！</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Try saying the following:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t1. Can I have my bill please? I&rsquo;m in Room 204.<br />\n\t2. The exact figure is 0.002.<br />\n\t3. Can you get back to me on 0208 775 3001.<br />\n\t4. Look, it&rsquo;s less than 0.0001! Let&rsquo;s not worry about it.<br />\n\t5. 0.75% won&rsquo;t make a lot of difference.</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p610101/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p610101\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p610510/\">重庆学生被美国神秘学校录取 揭秘深泉学院</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p610583/\">好记性和敏锐耳朵养成记：5月公开课精选</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p610433/\">想去美国国安局上班？先破解这条密码</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p609925/\">10个好习惯让你最大化利用时间</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p103560/\">沪江英语资料下载帮助及沪元知识</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p610491/\">费德勒又添双胞胎 儿女双全人生赢家</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p610401/\"> 2000名大学生公园纵酒狂欢 剑桥也疯狂</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p610914/\">周迅正式公开恋情 男方为美国华裔演员</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p610058/\">前《花花公子》模特街头乞讨 一天赚7美元</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p609647/\">美国小英雄：8岁男童为救姐姐被打死</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
