Some people say this has had a negative effect on their health.<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p>\n<p>\n\tWrite at least 250 words.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>model answer:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIt has recently been suggested that the way children eat and live nowadays has led to a deterioration in their health. I entirely agree with this view, and believe that this alarming situation has come about for several reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo begin with, there is the worrying increase in the amount of processed food that children are eating at home, with little or none of the fresh fruit and vegetables that earlier generations ate every day. Secondly, more and more young people are choosing to eat in fast-food restaurants, which may be harmless occasionally, but not every day. What they eat there is extremely high in fat, salt and sugar, all of which can be damaging to their health.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is also a disturbing decline in the amount of exercise they get. Schools have become obsessed with exams, with the shocking result that some pupils now do no sports at all. To make matters worse, few even get any exercise on the way to and from school, as most of them go in their parents&rsquo; cars rather than walk or cycle. Finally, children are spending far more time at home, playing computer games, watching TV or surfing the Internet. They no longer play outside with friends or take part in challenging outdoor activities.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo sum up, although none of these changes could, on its own, have caused widespread harm to children&rsquo;s health, there can be little doubt that all of them together have had a devastating effect. This, in my opinion, can only be reversed by encouraging children to return to move traditional ways of eating and living.</p>\n<p>\n\t以上就是全部内容，多多练习加以总结，作文会稳步提高的。希望本文对你有所帮助。</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p582929/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p582929\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p103560/\">沪江英语资料下载帮助及沪元知识</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582593/\">冬奥会美加冰球大战：谁输了留下比伯！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p579384/\">查分一起来：英语四级六级成绩查询活动汇总</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582896/\">美国女孩西雅图卖煎饼果子 吃货改变世界</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p580791/\">一位爸爸写给女儿的信：关于你未来的那个他</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582620/\">最惊喜：爸爸把自己打包变生日礼物送女儿</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582559/\">具足虫绝食5年死亡 吃过一条鱼后对美食无爱</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p580825/\">准备结婚了？10个好点子拍出创意婚纱照</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582649/\">沪江官方招聘：产品运营经理、营销策划等</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582205/\">女性找真爱多难？得吻过15个男人失恋两次！</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

Some people think this is due to problems such as the growing number of fast food outlets. Others believe that parents are to blame for not looking after their children's health.<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">To what extent do you agree with these views?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p>\n<p>\n\tWrite at least 250 words.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>model answer:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThere is plenty of evidence to suggest that children are overweight and the situation is getting worse, according to the medical experts. I feel there are a number of reasons for this.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome people blame the fact that we are surrounded by shops selling unhealthy, fatty foods such as chips and fried chicken, at low prices. This has created a whole generation of adults who have never cooked a meal for themselves. If there were fewer of these restaurants, then children would not be tempted to buy take-away food.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is another argument that blames the parents for allowing their children to become overweight. I tend to agree with this view, because good eating habits begin early in life, long before children start to visit fast food outlets. If children are given chips and chocolate rather than nourishing food, or are always allowed to choose what they eat, they will go for the sweet and salty foods every time, and this will carry on throughout their lives.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is a third factor, however, which contributes to the situation. Children these days take very little exercise. They do not walk to school. When they get home, they sit in front of the television or their computers and play video games. Not only is this an unhealthy pastime, it also gives them time to eat more junk food. What they need is to go outside and play active games or sport.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two views discussed play an equal role in contributing to the problem, but I think we have to encourage young people to be more active, as well as steering them away from fast food outlets and bad eating habits. We need to have a balanced approach.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Position: </strong>Writer refers to a number of reasons in the introduction, and to the need for a balanced view in the conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Main ideas:</strong> First sentence of the second paragraph; first and second sentences of the third paragraph; second sentence of the fourth paragraph.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Linkers: </strong>and, according to, some people, such as, if, then, there is another argument, because, or, there is a third factor, however, not only, also, the two views discussed, but, as well as</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Reference words:</strong> the, this, who, themselves, these, this view, they, their, them</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Topic vocabulary: </strong>medical experts, shops, unhealthy, fatty foods, chips, cooked, take-away food, chocolate, sweet and salty, exercise, walk, television, computers, video games, unhealthy pastime, junk food, active games, sport, fast food outlets</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Sentence types: </strong>A wide range of complex structures and sentences is used.</p>\n<p>\n\t以上就是全部内容，多多练习加以总结，作文会稳步提高的。希望本文对你有所帮助。</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p582928/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p582928\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p103560/\">沪江英语资料下载帮助及沪元知识</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582593/\">冬奥会美加冰球大战：谁输了留下比伯！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p579384/\">查分一起来：英语四级六级成绩查询活动汇总</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582896/\">美国女孩西雅图卖煎饼果子 吃货改变世界</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p580791/\">一位爸爸写给女儿的信：关于你未来的那个他</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582620/\">最惊喜：爸爸把自己打包变生日礼物送女儿</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582559/\">具足虫绝食5年死亡 吃过一条鱼后对美食无爱</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p580825/\">准备结婚了？10个好点子拍出创意婚纱照</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582649/\">沪江官方招聘：产品运营经理、营销策划等</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p582205/\">女性找真爱多难？得吻过15个男人失恋两次！</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
