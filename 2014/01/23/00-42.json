This problem is a much-debated one in that it affects everybody in his or her daily lives.</p>\n<p>\n\t或：（如果是针对某一事件的题目，不是什么popular topic）If ____________(it is announced that a new movie theater may be built ____________), I will not be surprised to see ____________ (whether it is better to choose A or B) become a popular topic which is much talked about not only by ____________, but also by ____________. Although it seems that [sometimes we can not tell which one outweigh the other between A and B / they normally coexist peacefully], they deserve some close examination. [If three criteria were taken into account in comparing these two, I would prefer A. / As far as I am concerned, I vote for the latter]. There are no less than three advantages in A as rendered below:</p>\n<p>\n\t第二段第一点原因。第二点原因。第三点原因。</p>\n<p>\n\t第三段In conclusion, （it must be explained that these three reasons sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive than any one of them.）Only these three reasons are enough to make a person draw the conclusion that ____________ , not to mention there are more.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>对立观点式的三种模板之三</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t3．选A还是选B的确是一个热门话题，我们来研究一下，二者各有优势，不过我来选的话，A的优点还是比B多。</p>\n<p>\n\t第一段前两句同2，第三句</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile both the two [methods/choices] may have their advantages and disadvantages, they can be applied under different circumstances. Later on, I will explain my opinion about it.</p>\n<p>\n\t第二段：[A has the obvious advantage that / One very strong argument for A is that] ____________. But there lies intrinsic harmful characteristic in this method. Some [people/experts] [maintain/warn] that____________ Furthermore, ____________. Therefore we have no complete evidence to suggest that A is always better than B.</p>\n<p>\n\t第三段：On the other hand, choosing B also has advantages to some extent, For example, ____________. However, once again, it is important to see that under certain circumstances B will____________(disadvantage)</p>\n<p>\n\t或：Yet there are some people who cast serious doubts on B</p>\n<p>\n\t或：Although B does have its seemingly profound [advantages/ reason],in the meantime[there lie intrinsic [harmful characteristics/drawbacks] in it such as ________________________ / it can be achieved only conditionally because____________].</p>\n<p>\n\t第四段：（针对我个人的情况又可以说出一套理由）But if all these factors are contemplated, [as far as I am concerned / according to my knowledge], the advantages of A carry more weight than those of B because A fits [me/us students] better in two ways: In the first place, ____________, In the second place/secondly,____________Therefore from what we have discussed, we may safely come to the conclusion that choosing A is a rather wise decision.</p>\n<p>\n\t或：（我个人的情况说不出什么新的理由，只好说我觉得A优点就是比B多）</p>\n<p>\n\tIt seems very difficult for us to prefer one to another because all of them have their advantages and disadvantages to the extent that it is hard to distinguish. Yet that does not mean that they are all the same to me. Which one I prefer depends on my own experience, life style and [emotional concerns / educational background/____________]. [As far as I am concerned / According to my personality and fondness/ To be frank], I would like to choose A, because there are too many benefits that outnumber its disadvantages not to choose it. B, on the other hand, has advantages no more than its disadvantages</p>\n<p style=\"color: #999999; font-size: 12px;\">\n\t声明：沪江网高度重视知识产权保护，发现本网站发布的信息包含有侵犯其著作权的链接内容时，请联系我们，我们将做相应处理。</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p568897/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p568897\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p570654/\">《爱情公寓4》插曲《Gentleman》正式版</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p570280/\">老外在中国：我在中国考驾照 四次才通过</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p571122/\">2013全球百大英俊男士 你的男神上榜了吗？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p562471/\">面试巧回答:\"你上份工作薪水多少?\"</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p103560/\">沪江英语资料下载帮助及沪元知识</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p567374/\">当天才遇上天才：卷福和谢耳朵的10个共同点</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p562541/\">海外视角：大学假期里该做的几件事</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p570750/\">不逼婚了！中国母亲海外头版寻子回家过年</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p567740/\">开心词场词书推荐：《美国人常用俚语》</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p570674/\">中国超3成富豪已移民 美国成首选目的地</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
